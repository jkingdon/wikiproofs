Items which may be doable without a network connection:

* more intuitionistic logic
  - From intuitionistic to classical propositional logic.wiki
  - write SyllogismInConsequent (should hold intuitionistically)
* convenience theorems of propositional logic
  - any more in Basic Arithmetic?
* look at whether Raph's proof of ceqsex simplifies our development
  (I think it might enable omitting a bunch of strange little
  theorems).
* naming convention for implication builders
  a. addImplicationAntecedent (from addCommonAntecedent)
     ImplicationConsequentAddition (from CommonConsequentAddition)
     ImplicationConsequentBuilder (from ImplicationBuilderRR)
     ImplicationConsequentBuilderInConsequent
     buildImplicationAntecedent
     buildImplication
     buildImplicationConsequentInConsequent (from buildCommonConsequentInConsequent)

To do with network:
