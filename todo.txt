Items which may be doable without a network connection:

* convenience theorems of propositional logic
  - joinConsequents (do without, probably)
* look at whether Raph's proof of ceqsex simplifies our development
  (I think it might enable omitting a bunch of strange little
  theorems).
  - the proof does need Quantifiability but nothing else we don't have.
  - ceqsex is ImplicitThereExists.
    - ImplicitSubstitutionThereExists
      - ImplicitSubstitutionForAll
        - ax9oc (see also equs4c)
          - ax6o (see also NegationNotFree, ax9o)
        - a5i
  - ceqsex also has the distinct variable constraint x s.

  * ax9o is only used by equs4.
* Probably don't need to define Subst as an axiom (see peano_thms.gh for how to avoid it)

* General set theory
  - definitions and consequences: union?,
    intersection, difference (e.g. eldifi and similar), subset
  - do both directions of A = B ↔ { A } = { B } hold? (think so)
  - indexed union or intersection? (if needed for functions)
  - prove Peano axioms from them
    - suc11
  - finite induction (e.g. peano5 in set.mm)
  - functions and relations (e.g. cxp and following in set.mm)
    - binary relations.
      - releq
      (mkrelation a A b B φ) (A, B object; a, b variable; φ formula)
        ≝ {〈a, b〉| a ∈ A ∧ b ∈ B ∧ φ }
        e.g. (mkrelation ℕ ℕ a b (∃ n ∈ ℕ a + n = b))
      - (relates s (mkrelation a A b B φ) t) ↔ [s / a][t / b]φ  (probably some distinct)
    - domain and range: dfdm3 and dfrn2 or some such (need to prove existence)
      - dmeq
      - breldm, brelrn
      - (domain (mkrelation a A b B φ)) ⊆ A
      - (range (mkrelation a A b B φ)) ⊆ B
    - functions
      - dffun2 (how to deal with the distinct variables?), funrel
      (lambda x t)
        e.g. (lambda x A 〈x, 1〉)
        ≝ {〈x, result〉| x ∈ A ∧ result = φ }
      - [s / x](apply (lambda x A t) s) = t
        this reads oddly, because [/] only applies to formulas, not terms
    - cross products, e.g. cxp, df-xp, elxp, opelxp1, opelxp
      xpss regarding existence of cross products (note dependence on
      ax-pow, which is more explicit in xpsspw). Also note dependence on defn of
      ordered pair.
      - (relation A) ↔ ∃ x ∃ y A ⊆ x × y
    - note dmex depends on ax-pow and ax-un, but doesn't need replacement.
  - recursion theorem (see downloaded wikipedia page, Joedit)
    = frfnom and friends in set.mm
      - e.g. http://us.metamath.org/mpeuni/df-rdg.html

To do with network:

We refer to this process as gathering (that is, gathering the quantifiers together at the start of the formula) or scattering (the opposite).
