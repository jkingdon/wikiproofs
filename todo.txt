Items which may be doable without a network connection:

* look at whether Raph's proof of ceqsex simplifies our development
  (I think it might enable omitting a bunch of strange little
  theorems).
  - the proof does need Quantifiability but nothing else we don't have.
  - ceqsex is ImplicitThereExists.
    - ImplicitSubstitutionThereExists
      - ImplicitSubstitutionForAll
        - ax9oc (see also equs4c)
          - ax6o (see also NegationNotFree, ax9o)
        - a5i
  - ceqsex also has the distinct variable constraint x s.

  * ax9o is only used by equs4.

* Maybe DRY up CollinearityCollinearity. The lemmas for the various pieces of the
  distributivity in breaking up the 9 cases would reduce duplicative proofs, but
  might be slightly awkward to name.

* Set theory
  - can handle singletons a bit more concisely by defining { A } as { A, A }
  - intersection, difference (e.g. eldifi and similar)
  - state A = B ↔ { A } = { B } ? (see sneqr)
  - indexed union or intersection? (if needed for functions)
  - prove Peano axioms from set theory
    - suc11
  - finite induction (e.g. peano5 in set.mm)
  - functions and relations (e.g. cxp and following in set.mm)
    - binary relations.
      - releq (builder for relation predicate)
      (makeRelation a A b B φ) (A, B object; a, b variable; φ formula)
        ≝ {〈a, b〉| a ∈ A ∧ b ∈ B ∧ φ }
        ≝ { z ∈ A × B | ∃ a ∃ b z = 〈 a, b 〉 ∧ φ }
        e.g. (mkrelation a ℕ b ℕ (∃ n ∈ ℕ a + n = b))
      - (relates s (mkrelation a A b B φ) t) ↔ [s / a][t / b]φ  (probably some distinct)
    - domain and range: df-dm and dfrn2 or some such (need to prove existence)
        - dmexg for existence
          - follows from dmrnssfld
        - define domain A as { x ∈ ⋃ ⋃ A | ∃ y 〈x, y〉 ∈ A }
          - lemma: ∃ y 〈x, y〉 ∈ A → x ∈ ⋃ ⋃ A
            which implies: B ∈ domain A ↔ [ B / x ] ∃ y 〈x, y〉 ∈ A
        - then want B ∈ domain A ↔ ∃ y 〈B, y〉 ∈ A (eldm2)

        - already proved 〈 x, y 〉 ∈ R → { x, y } ∈ ⋃ R (Domain-1)
          〈 x, y 〉 ∈ R → { x, y } ∈ ⋃ R (Domain-1)
                       → { x, y } ⊆ ⋃ ⋃ R  (by elssuni)
                       → x ∈ { x, y } → x ∈ ⋃ ⋃ R (by SubsetMembership)
          then detach x ∈ { x, y } which is UnorderedPairLeftMembership
          then addThereExistsToConsequent
        - elssuni: A ∈ B → A ⊆ ⋃B
          - ssuni: A ⊆ B ∧ B ∈ C → A ⊆ ⋃C
            various predicate logic steps
          - A ⊆ A (by SubsetReflexivity)
      - dmeq
      - breldm, brelrn
      - (domain (makeRelation a A b B φ)) ⊆ A
      - (range (makeRelation a A b B φ)) ⊆ B
      - (relation { 〈A, B〉 } )
        { 〈A, B〉 } = { A } × { B }
        B ≠ ∅ → domain (A × B) = A (dmxp)
    - functions
      - dffun2 (how to deal with the distinct variables?), funrel
      (lambda x t)
        e.g. (lambda x A 〈x, 1〉)
        ≝ {〈x, result〉| x ∈ A ∧ result = t }
      - [s / x](apply (lambda x A t) s) = t
        this reads oddly, because [/] only applies to formulas, not terms
        (metamath has underlined [/] for terms; do we want that?)
    - cross products
      - (relation A) ↔ ∃ x ∃ y A ⊆ x × y
      - (relation A) ↔ A ⊆ domain A × range A  (right?)
  - recursion theorem (see downloaded wikipedia page, Joedit)
    = frfnom and friends in set.mm
      - e.g. http://us.metamath.org/mpeuni/df-rdg.html

* Needed to derive geometry axioms from reals (page 201 of Givant1999)
  - to define ≡
    • subtraction
    • 1st, 2nd
      - op1sta ⋃ domain { 〈A, B〉 } = A
        • dmsnop domain { 〈A, B〉 } = { A } (metamath proof is involved)
        • (have) unieq UnionBuilder A = B → ⋃ A = ⋃ B
        • unisn ⋃ { A } = A
        (each of these is proved in terms of various things we probably want,
        but don't have yet)
  - ≤ for reals (defined in terms of <)
  - (x - y) · (x - y) = (y - x) · (y - x) (needed to prove CongruenceABBA)
  - builders for +, ·
  - For CongruenceIdentity
    • x - x = 0
    • x - y = 0 → x = y
    • x ∈ ℝ → 0 ≤ x · x
    • 0 ≤ x ∧ 0 ≤ y ∧ x + y = 0 → x = 0 (or some such)
  - For Indivisibility
    • (x - y) · (y - x) ≤ 0
    • antisymmetry
    • (x - y) · (y - x) = 0 → x = y (follows from x · y = 0 → x = 0 or y = 0)

* Probably worth a convenience theorem for  ThereExistsConjunctionRightMovement +
 eliminateBiconditionalForward +
 applySyllogism

* Is there a metamath equivalent of Separation? In particular, I'm curious about
whether the distinct variable constraints turn out the same.
  - rabid is sort of a special case

To do with network:

* notation for congruent angles. Convention is ∠ABC ≅ ∠DEF, right?  Then maybe (A B C ∠≅ D E F) for us?

* rename IndivisibilityBidirectional to IndivisibilityBiconditional, I think.

* Continue changing CongruenceIdentityFromEquality to be the imported version.

* Throughout First-order logic with quantifiability (and probably First-order logic), add spaces (e.g. change ∃xφ to ∃ x φ).

* figure out what spell checking dictionary to install to shut up git gui.
