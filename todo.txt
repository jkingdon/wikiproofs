Items which may be doable without a network connection:

* more intuitionistic logic
  - From intuitionistic to classical propositional logic.wiki
  - write SyllogismInConsequent (should hold intuitionistically)
* convenience theorems of propositional logic
  - any more in Basic Arithmetic?
* look at whether Raph's proof of ceqsex simplifies our development
  (I think it might enable omitting a bunch of strange little
  theorems).
* naming convention for implication builders
  a. addImplicationAntecedent (from addCommonAntecedent)
     ImplicationConsequentAddition (from CommonConsequentAddition)
     ImplicationConsequentBuilder (from ImplicationBuilderRR)
     ImplicationConsequentBuilderInConsequent
     buildImplicationAntecedent
     buildImplication
     buildImplicationConsequentInConsequent (from buildCommonConsequentInConsequent)
* General set theory
  - singleton, unordered pair, ordered pair
  - definitions and consequences: opth from set.mm, union,
    intersection, difference (e.g. eldifi and similar), subset
  - singleton, unordered pair ("pair"?), ordered pair ("cons"?)
    = elsn provides "definition" of singleton, with axiom of
      adjunction being the key to the proof, but how to express
      in jhilbert?
      x = s <-> x element-of { s }
      also s = t <-> s element-of { t }   (elsncg, basically)
  - indexed union or intersection? (if needed for functions)
  - binary relations. Notation (relates s R t) ?
  - prove Peano axioms from them
  - finite induction (e.g. peano5 in set.mm)
  - functions and relations (e.g. cxp and following in set.mm)
  - recursion theorem (see downloaded wikipedia page, Joedit)
    = frfnom and friends in set.mm
    = what is "rec"? some kind of recursion definition...

To do with network:

Look at/download stanford encyclopedia of philosophy Basic Set Theory:
http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/set-theory/primer.html

Take at least a glance at http://www.math.ufl.edu/%7Ejal/set_theory.html (mentioned by stanford encyclopedia of philosophy)
