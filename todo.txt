Items which may be doable without a network connection:

* more intuitionistic logic
  - NegationBuilder follows easily from TranspositionIntroduction
  - ModusTollens - seems easy
  - CaseElimination - variant with disjunctions.  Can we show that the full version implies TertiumNonDatur? (informally, I guess, although I suppose we could have a bunch of interface files for TertiumNonDatur equivalences).
* convenience theorems of propositional logic
  - any more in Basic Arithmetic?
* look at whether Raph's proof of ceqsex simplifies our development
  (I think it might enable omitting a bunch of strange little
  theorems).
* naming convention for implication builders
  a. addImplicationAntecedent (from addCommonAntecedent)
     ImplicationConsequentAddition (from CommonConsequentAddition)
     ImplicationConsequentBuilder (from ImplicationBuilderRR)
     ImplicationConsequentBuilderInConsequent
     buildImplicationAntecedent
     buildImplication
     buildImplicationConsequentInConsequent (from buildCommonConsequentInConsequent)

To do with network:

* download wikipedia page on intuitionistic logic
* stanford encyclopedia of philosophy article while I'm at it
* upload proofs
