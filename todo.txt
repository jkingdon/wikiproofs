Items which may be doable without a network connection:

* prove sb8 (see User:Kingdon for a few notes)
* think about sbn
* sb8e, once sb8/sbn done
* definitions versus dummies (LessThan), once sb8e done

* more intuitionistic logic
  - easy disjunction/conjunction theorems
  - get going on negation
  - biconditional (should mostly be copy-paste from Principia, I think)
* convenience theorems of propositional logic
  - buildDisjunctionLL in First-order logic
  - Basic Arithmetic has at least a few
* look at whether Raph's proof of ceqsex simplifies our development
  (I think it might enable omitting a bunch of strange little
  theorems).

To do with network:

* move BiconditionalBuilderRR, ImplicationBuilderRR from basic arithmetic and update scattered theorems
* rename exbidv to buildThereExistsInConsequent (I think, check this is right), and move to
  [[First-order logic]]
* look at metamath proof of sb56 and see if we are ready to prove
  sbc56.
