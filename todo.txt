Items which may be doable without a network connection:

* arithmetic
  - a ≤ a (leid in peano_thms)

* convenience theorems of propositional logic
  - any more in Basic Arithmetic?
* look at whether Raph's proof of ceqsex simplifies our development
  (I think it might enable omitting a bunch of strange little
  theorems).
* naming convention for implication builders
  a. addImplicationAntecedent (from addCommonAntecedent)
     ImplicationConsequentAddition (from CommonConsequentAddition)
     ImplicationConsequentBuilder (from ImplicationBuilderRR)
     ImplicationConsequentBuilderInConsequent
     buildImplicationAntecedent
     buildImplication
     buildImplicationConsequentInConsequent (from buildCommonConsequentInConsequent)
* General set theory
  - ordered pair
  - definitions and consequences: opth from set.mm, union?,
    intersection, difference (e.g. eldifi and similar), subset
  - cite metamath?
    = elsn provides "definition" of singleton
      x = A ↔ x ∈ { A }
      also A = B ↔ A ∈ { B }   (elsncg, basically)
      do both directions of A = B ↔ { A } = { B } hold? (think so)
  - indexed union or intersection? (if needed for functions)
  - binary relations. Notation (relates s R t) ?
  - prove Peano axioms from them
  - finite induction (e.g. peano5 in set.mm)
  - functions and relations (e.g. cxp and following in set.mm)
  - recursion theorem (see downloaded wikipedia page, Joedit)
    = frfnom and friends in set.mm
      - e.g. http://us.metamath.org/mpeuni/df-rdg.html

Because [[Help:JHilbert|JHilbert]] does not currently follow redirects when processing proofs, redirects should not exist in interfaces or modules. If you want to [[w:WP:MOVE|move a page]], first move it, then remove all references to the old name, then [[Wikiproofs:Administrator requests|ask an administrator]] to delete the redirect.
