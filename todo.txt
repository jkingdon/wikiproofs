Items which may be doable without a network connection:

* more intuitionistic logic
  - NegationBuilder follows easily from TranspositionIntroduction
  - distributive laws. the principia proof works except for:
thm (DisjunctionLeftDistribution-reverse () () (((p ∨ q) ∧ (p ∨ r)) → (p ∨ (q ∧ r))) (

  - DisjunctionLeftDistribution - both directions seem to be straightforward from composeConjunction or composeDisjunction, and the usual suspects (copy-paste from principia)
  - ModusTollens - seems easy
  - biconditional (should mostly be copy-paste from Principia, I think)
* convenience theorems of propositional logic
  - any more in Basic Arithmetic?
* look at whether Raph's proof of ceqsex simplifies our development
  (I think it might enable omitting a bunch of strange little
  theorems).
* naming convention for implication builders
  a. addImplicationAntecedent (from addCommonAntecedent)
     ImplicationConsequentAddition (from CommonConsequentAddition)
     ImplicationConsequentBuilder (from ImplicationBuilderRR)
     ImplicationConsequentBuilderInConsequent
     buildImplicationAntecedent
     buildImplication
     buildImplicationConsequentInConsequent (from buildCommonConsequentInConsequent)

To do with network:
