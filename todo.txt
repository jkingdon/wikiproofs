Items which may be doable without a network connection:

* definitions versus dummies (LessThan)
* more intuitionistic logic
  - easy disjunction/conjunction theorems
  - get going on negation
  - biconditional (should mostly be copy-paste from Principia, I think)
* convenience theorems of propositional logic (e.g. buildDisjunctionLL)
  - go through Classical propositional logic to see what might go here
  - think through how/whether to parameterize this to work with intuitionistic logic
* add â‰  to first-order logic interface

To do with network:

* download more pages (which?)
* see how metamath proves sb8e
