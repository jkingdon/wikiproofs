Items which may be doable without a network connection:

* prove sb8 (see User:Kingdon for notes)
* sb8e, once sb8/sbn done
* definitions versus dummies (LessThan), once sb8e done

* more intuitionistic logic
  - easy disjunction/conjunction theorems
  - get going on negation
  - DoubleNegatedConjunction, DoubleNegatedDisjunction
  - rest of DeMorgan
  - NegationBuilder follows easily from TranspositionIntroduction
  - biconditional (should mostly be copy-paste from Principia, I think)
* convenience theorems of propositional logic
  - buildDisjunctionLL in First-order logic
  - any more in Basic Arithmetic?
* look at whether Raph's proof of ceqsex simplifies our development
  (I think it might enable omitting a bunch of strange little
  theorems).
* naming convention for implication builders
  a. addImplicationAntecedent (from addCommonAntecedent)
     ImplicationConsequentAddition (from CommonConsequentAddition)
     ImplicationConsequentBuilder (from ImplicationBuilderRR)
     ImplicationConsequentBuilderInConsequent
     buildImplicationAntecedent
     buildImplication
     buildImplicationConsequentInConsequent (from buildCommonConsequentInConsequent)
  b. addImplicationLL
     buildImplicationLL
     buildImplication
     buildImplicationRRInConsequent
