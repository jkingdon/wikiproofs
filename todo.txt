Items which may be doable without a network connection:

* prove sb8
* think about sbn
* sb8e, once sb8/sbn done
* definitions versus dummies (LessThan), once sb8e done

* more intuitionistic logic
  - easy disjunction/conjunction theorems
  - get going on negation
  - biconditional (should mostly be copy-paste from Principia, I think)
* convenience theorems of propositional logic
  - buildDisjunctionLL in First-order logic
  - go through Classical propositional logic to see what might go here
  - Basic Arithmetic has at least a few

To do with network:
