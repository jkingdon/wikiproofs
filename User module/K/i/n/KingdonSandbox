We define an order on natural numbers:

<jh>
def ((≤ a b) (∃ n ((a + (value n)) = b)))
</jh>

<jh>
#thm (ZeroSmallest () () ((0) ≤ a) (
#        a AdditiveIdentityLeft
#))
</jh>

Here's roughly where this is going next:
 n = b → (0 + n = b ↔ 0 + b = b)
 (subst b n (0 + n = b)) ↔ 0 + b = b
The missing theorem from [[Interface:First-order logic]] is <code>(subst s x φ) → (∃ x φ)</code>

We'll show that it has the [[w:Total order|expected properties of an order]].

    If a ≤ b and b ≤ a then a = b (antisymmetry);
    If a ≤ b and b ≤ c then a ≤ c (transitivity);
    a ≤ b or b ≤ a (totality). 
(probably reflexivity too, although that is a consequence of totality)
