We start with the [[Interface:Classical propositional calculus|theorems of propositional logic]] and [[Interface:Axioms of first-order logic]]:

<jh>
import (CLASSICAL Interface:Classical_propositional_calculus () ())
import (PRINCIPIA Interface:Axioms_of_first-order_logic (CLASSICAL) ())
</jh>

As usual, φ, ψ, χ, and θ are formulas and x, y, and z are objects:

<jh>
var (wff φ ψ χ θ)
var (object x y z)
</jh>

== Equality is reflexive and symmetric ==
The basic facts about equality are that it is reflexive, symmetric and transitive. Instead of supposing these as axioms, we have a single axiom which implies them (when combined with some of the other axioms).

We start with reflexivity, which we prove in several steps:

<jh>
thm (EqualityReflexivity-1 () () ((x = y) → (y = y)) (
        (x = y) ConjunctionIdempotence eliminateRightBiconditionalImplication

        x y y AxiomEquality
        import

        applySyllogism
))

thm (EqualityReflexivity-2 () () ((∀ x (¬ (y = y))) → (∀ x (¬ (x = y)))) (
        x y EqualityReflexivity-1
        introduceTransposition
        x generalize

        x (¬ (y = y)) (¬ (x = y)) QuantifiedImplication
        applyModusPonens
))
</jh>

The proof of reflexivity itself involves adding an extra variable <code>x</code>. We need to specify that this variable is distinct from y, but this doesn't affect the generality of the result. The variable <code>x</code> only appear in the proof, not in the theorem, and so the distinct variable constraint only needs to appear here, not in the statement of the theorem in [[Interface:First-order logic]].
<jh>
thm (EqualityReflexivity ((x y)) () (y = y) (
        x y Existence

        (¬ (y = y)) x Generalization
        x y EqualityReflexivity-2
        applySyllogism

        applyModusTollens
        eliminateDoubleNegation
))
</jh>

== Specification ==
We first prove the theorem that we can remove a universal quantifier.

<jh>
#thm (Specialization () () ((∀ x φ) → φ) (
#        y x Existence
#        (¬ ((∀ x φ) → φ)) y Generalization
#        
#))
</jh>

== Builder for ∀ ==
<jh>
#thm (addForAll () (φ ↔ ψ) (∀xφ ↔ ∀xψ) (
#))
</jh>

== Relationship between universal and existential quantification ==
The axioms are written in terms of just the universal quantifier ∀. We define the existential quantifier ∃ in terms of it:

<jh>
def ((∃ x φ) (¬ (∀ x (¬ φ))))
</jh>

and the following two theorems are immediate consequences from this definition:

<jh>
thm (NotThereExists () () ((¬ (∃ x φ)) ↔ (∀ x (¬ φ))) (
        (∃ x φ) BiconditionalReflexivity
        addNegation

        (∀ x (¬ φ)) DoubleNegation swapBiconditional
        applyBiconditionalTransitivity
))

# Think we need addForAll for this
#thm (NotForAll () () ((¬ (∀ x φ)) ↔ (∃ x (¬ φ))) (
#))
</jh>
