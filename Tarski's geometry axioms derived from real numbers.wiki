The [[Interface:Tarski's geometry axioms|geometry axioms]] of Tarski can be constructed from real numbers.

TODO: real closed fields, page number for std Euclidean construction in Givant1999 paper.

We import the theorems of [[Interface:Classical propositional calculus|propositional logic]] and [[Interface:First-order logic with quantifiability|predicate logic]], [[Interface:Set theory|set theory]] and the [[Interface:Complex number axioms|complex numbers]].

<jh>
import (CLASSICAL Interface:Classical_propositional_calculus () ())
import (FIRSTORDER Interface:First-order_logic_with_quantifiability (CLASSICAL) ())
import (SETS Interface:Set_theory (CLASSICAL) ())
import (COMPLEX Interface:Complex_number_axioms (CLASSICAL FIRSTORDER SETS) ())
</jh>

The quantifiers we just imported range over sets. When it comes time to export, we'll need quantifiers which range over points.

== Option One ==
<jh>
import (FIRSTORDER_POINTS Interface:First-order_logic_with_quantifiability (CLASSICAL) (Points.))
</jh>

== Export ==
<jh>
export (GEOMETRY Interface:Tarski's_geometry_axioms (CLASSICAL FIRSTORDER_POINTS) ())
</jh>
