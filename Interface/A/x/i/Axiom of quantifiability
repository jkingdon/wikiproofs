 | notes    = The axiom of quantifiability asserts that any object (term) can be made equal to a variable which is subject to quantification.  It corresponds roughly to the notion that there are no [[w:proper class|proper classes]].

In [[Interface:First-order logic]], we present a theory which deals with quantifiers (∀ and ∃), free variables, and the substitution of one variable for another. However, there is an issue with substitution of a term for a variable. To make this work as straightforwardly as substitution of a variable for a variable, we put forth an axiom here which we call the axiom of quantifiability. It is a variant of the axiom of existence which says that any object can be made equal to a variable.

== The axiom ==
We build on [[Interface:Classical propositional calculus]] and [[Interface:First-order logic]]:
<jh>
param (CLASSICAL Interface:Classical_propositional_calculus () ())
param (FIRSTORDER Interface:First-order_logic (CLASSICAL) ())
</jh>

The axiom:

<jh>
var (object s)
var (variable x)

stmt (Quantifiability () () (∃ x ((value x) = s)) )
</jh>

I'm not esaliy impressed. . . but that's impressing me! :)
