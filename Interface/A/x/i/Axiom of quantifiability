In [[Interface:First-order logic]], we present a theory which deals with quantifiers (∀ and ∃), free variables, and the substitution of one variable for another. However, there is an issue with substitution of a term for a variable. To make this work as straightforwardly as substitution of a variable for a variable, we put forth an axiom here which we call the axiom of quantifiability. It is a variant of the axiom of existence which says that we can introduce a variable equal to a given variable.

== Prerequisities ==
We build on [[Interface:Classical propositional calculus]] and [[Interface:First-order logic]]:

param (CLASSICAL Interface:Classical_propositional_calculus () ())
param (FIRSTORDER Interface:First-order_logic (CLASSICAL) ())
</jh>

== Equality between terms ==
The axiom of quantifiability is all about equality between terms, not just equality between variables (the latter is what is covered in [[Interface:Axioms of first-order logic]]). So we first define term equality much the way that variable equality was defined in [[Interface:Axioms of first-order logic]]. [[Interface:Equality of classes]] has a different approach (which also defines term equality, but in a way consistent with metamath-style proper classes, and not consistent with the axiom of quantifiability).<ref>[http://us.metamath.org/mpeuni/df-cleq.html df-cleq], metamath's set.mm, accessed April 16, 2012</ref>

<jh>
var (object s t u)
stmt (TermEqualityAxiom () () ((s = t) → ((s = u) → (t = u))))
</jh>

== The axiom of quantifiability ==

The axiom:

<jh>
var (variable x)

stmt (Quantifiability ((x s)) () (∃ x ((value x) = s)) )
</jh>

== Consequences ==
In some formulations of [[w:set theory|set theory]], for example metamath's set.mm, a variable (something which can be quantified over) corresponds to a set, and an object corresponds to a class.

As can be seen in more detail in [[First-order logic with quantifiability]] and [[Interface:First-order logic with quantifiability]], the axiom of quantifiability allows substitution of a term for a variable.  In metamath's set.mm, such substitution is still possible, but it requires an additional hypothesis.  For example, set.mm's <code>vtocl</code> has as a hypothesis <code>A ∈ V</code> which means "A is not a proper class".<ref>[http://us.metamath.org/mpeuni/vtocl.html vtocl] in metamath's set.mm, accessed May 6, 2010</ref>

First-order logic with quantifiability works fine for Peano arithmetic (see for example Raph Levien's peano_thms<ref>[http://levien.com/garden/ghnew/peano/ Peano], accessed 6 May 2010</ref>), and set theories without proper classes, such as ZF.

== Similar axioms/theorems in other systems ==
Metamath's set.mm has a theorem <code>A ∈ B → ∃ x x = A</code> (where <code>A</code> and <code>B</code> are classes and <code>x</code> is a variable),<ref>[http://us.metamath.org/mpeuni/elex.html elex], accessed 31 May 2010</ref> which closely resembles our axiom of quantifiability except for A ∈ B (which means "A is not a proper class").
