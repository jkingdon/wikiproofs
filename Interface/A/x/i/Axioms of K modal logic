[[w:Modal logic|Modal logic]] builds on [[Interface:Classical propositional calculus|propositional logic]] and adds two concepts, ''necessity'' and ''possibility''. The formula <code>□ p</code> means that <code>p</code> is necessarily true and <code>◊ p</code> means that <code>p</code> is possibly true. They behave a little bit like the quantifiers ∀ and ∃ of [[Interface:First-order logic|predicate logic]], although they don't quantify a particular variable.

Here we present axioms for the weakest commonly studied modal logic, called K.

<jh>
param (PROPOSITIONAL Interface:Classical_propositional_calculus () ())

term (formula (□ formula))
term (formula (◊ formula))

var (formula p q)
</jh>

The rule of necessitation is analogous to the axiom of generalization of [[Interface:First-order logic|predicate logic]].<ref>axiom N, page 20 of Hughes and Cresswell</ref><ref>Necessitation Rule of Garson</ref>
<jh>
stmt (Necessitation () (p) (□ p))
</jh>

We can distribute necessity across an implication.<ref>axiom K, page 20 of Hughes and Cresswell</ref><ref>Distribution Axiom of Garson</ref>
<jh>
stmt (NecessityImplication () () ((□ (p → q)) → ((□ p) → (□ q))))
</jh>
