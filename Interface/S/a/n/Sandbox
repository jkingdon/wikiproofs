This page allows you to carry out experiments.  Note that JHilbert behaves differently depending on whether it is in the Interface namespace or the main namespace, and is not enabled at all in the User namespace.  Hence the sandbox pages.

== Well-formed formulas ==

(An experimental, edited version of the master copy at [[Interface:Classical propositional calculus]]).

We first introduce the kind of [[w:well-formed formulas|well-formed formulas]] and a few variables for this kind.
<jh>
kind (wff)
var (wff p q r s)
</jh>

== Logical connectives ==

There are five standard [[w:logical connective|logical connective]]s in the classical propositional calculus, [[w:negation|negation]],
<jh>
term (wff (¬ wff))
</jh>
[[w:material conditional|implication]],
<jh>
term (wff (→ wff wff))
</jh>
[[w:logical disjunction|disjunction]],
<jh>
term (wff (∨ wff wff))
</jh>
[[w:logical conjunction|conjunction]],
<jh>
term (wff (∧ wff wff))
</jh>
and, finally, the [[w:logical biconditional|biconditional]],
<jh>
term (wff (↔ wff wff))
</jh>
In addition, one can also consider the constant formulas (or [[w:nullary#Nullary|nullary]] connectives) "the true",
<jh>
term (wff (⊤))
</jh>
and "the false",
<jh>
term (wff (⊥))
</jh>
