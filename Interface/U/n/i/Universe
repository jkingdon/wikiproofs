We need enough parameters to define set theory.
<jh>
param (CLASSICAL Interface:Classical_propositional_calculus () ())
param (FIRSTORDER Interface:First-order_logic_with_quantifiability (CLASSICAL) set.)
param (SETS Interface:Set_theory (CLASSICAL FIRSTORDER) ())
</jh>

Now we define the universe, and that's all we need to do here. The rest is in [[Interface:Restricting all quantifiers]] and the module which is restricting the quantifiers (for example [[Tarski's geometry axioms in terms of real numbers]]).
<jh>
term (set.object (universe))
