We need enough parameters to define <code>ℝ × ℝ</code>.
<jh>
param (CLASSICAL Interface:Classical_propositional_calculus () ())
param (FIRSTORDER Interface:First-order_logic_with_quantifiability (CLASSICAL) set.)
param (SETS Interface:Set_theory (CLASSICAL FIRSTORDER) ())
param (COMPLEX Interface:Complex_number_axioms (CLASSICAL FIRSTORDER SETS) ())
</jh>

Now we define the universe, and that's all we need to do here. The rest is in [[Interface:Restricting all quantifiers]].
<jh>
def ((universe) ((ℝ) × (ℝ)))
