 | notes    = The first-order [[w:Peano axioms|Peano axioms]] are the most widely used formalism for [[w:Arithmetic|arithmetic]] (that is, the natural numbers: zero, one, two, ...). They are stronger than the axioms of [[w:Robinson arithmetic|Robinson arithmetic]] (which are similar but omit the induction axiom) and weaker than systems like [[w:Second-order arithmetic|second-order arithmetic]] or most kinds of set theory (such as [[w:Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory|ZFC]]).

First, we adopt the axioms of [[Interface:Classical propositional calculus|propositional logic]] and [[Interface:First-order logic|first-order logic]] (including equality):

<jh>
param (CLASSICAL Interface:Classical_propositional_calculus () ())
param (FIRSTORDER Interface:First-order_logic (CLASSICAL) ())
</jh>

The kind <code>object</code>, defined in first-order logic, represents a natural number:
<jh>
kindbind (object nat)
var (nat n m)
</jh>

There is a number zero:

<jh>
term (nat (0))
</jh>

There is a successor operation:
<jh>
term (nat (succ nat))
</jh>

Zero is not the successor of any number:
<jh>
stmt (ZeroNotSuccessor () () (¬ ((0) = (succ n))))
</jh>

Each number is the successor of only one number:
<jh>
stmt (Successor () () (((succ m) = (succ n)) → (m = n)))
</jh>

[[w:mathematical induction|Induction]]:
<jh>
var (formula φ)
stmt (Induction () () (((subst (0) n φ) ∧ (φ → (subst (succ n) n φ))) → (∀ n φ)))
</jh>

We also supply axioms for addition and multiplication.

<jh>
term (nat (+ nat nat))
stmt (AdditiveIdentity () () ((n + (0)) = n))
stmt (Addition () () ((n + (succ m)) = (succ (n + m))))

term (nat (· nat nat))
stmt (MultiplicativeZero () () ((n · (0)) = (0)))
stmt (Multiplication () () ((n · (succ m)) = (n + (n · m))))
</jh>
