== Well-formed formulas ==

We first introduce the kind of [[w:well-formed formula|well-formed formula]]s, abbreviated as "wff". This kind subsumes the Principia Mathematica concepts of elementary and non-elementary propositions and, due to the recursive nature of JHilbert, propositional functions as well. We also introduce three variables, <math>p,q,r</math>, as placeholders for wffs.
<jh>
kind (wff)
var (wff p q r)
</jh>

== Logical connectives ==

Of the standard five [[w:logical connective|logical connective]]s of classical propositional logic, Principia requires only [[w:disjunction|disjunction]] (<math>\vee</math>-symbol) and [[w:implication|implication]] (<math>\rightarrow</math>-symbol) for its axioms. However, disjunction and [[w:negation|negation]] (<math>\neg</math>-symbol) are actually used as primitive logical connective. Implication is defined from them:
<jh>
term (wff (¬ wff)) # Negation
term (wff (∨ wff wff)) # Disjunction
def ((→ p q) ((¬ p) ∨ q)) # Implication, *1.01
</jh>

== The axioms ==

We are now in the position to state the six axioms for propositional logic of Principia (five, if you don't count the rule of detachment).
