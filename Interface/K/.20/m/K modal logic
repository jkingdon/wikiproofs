Here are some theorems designed to illustrate [[w:Modal logic|modal logic]]. We build on [[Interface:Classical propositional calculus|classical propositional logic]]. The theorems here hold in the weakest commonly studied modal logic, called K.

We add two concepts to propositional logic, ''necessity'' and ''possibility''. The formula <code>□ p</code> means that <code>p</code> is necessarily true and <code>◊ p</code> means that <code>p</code> is possibly true. They behave a little bit like the quantifiers ∀ and ∃ of [[Interface:First-order logic|predicate logic]], although they don't quantify a particular variable.

Necessity can be collected across a disjunction<ref>exercise 1.1(b), page 17 and theorem K4, page 25 of Hughes and Cresswell</ref> and collected or distributed across a conjunction<ref>exercise 1.1(c), page 17 and theorem K3, page 23 of Hughes and Cresswell</ref>

stmt (NecessityDisjunctionCollection () () (((□ p) ∨ (□ q)) → (□ (p ∨ q))))
stmt (NecessityConjunction () () ((□ (p ∧ q)) ↔ ((□ p) ∧ (□ q))))
</jh>

The converse of <code>NecessityDisjunctionCollection</code> does not hold but there is result which is a bit like its converse.<ref>theorem K9, page 29 of Hughes and Cresswell</ref>
<jh>
stmt (NecessityDisjunctionDistribution () () ((□ (p ∨ q)) → ((□ p) ∨ (◊ q))))
</jh>

Possibility can be distributed across a conjunction.<ref>theorem K8, page 29 of Hughes and Cresswell</ref>
<jh>
stmt (PossibilityConjunction () () ((◊ (p ∧ q)) → ((◊ p) ∧ (◊ q))))
</jh>

We can distribute necessity across an implication.<ref>axiom K, page 20 of Hughes and Cresswell</ref><ref>Distribution Axiom of Garson</ref>
<jh>
stmt (NecessityImplication () () ((□ (p → q)) → ((□ p) → (□ q))))
</jh>

Here is a rule form of <code>NecessityImplication</code><ref>theorem DR1, page 25 of Hughes and Cresswell</ref> and the corresponding rule for the biconditional.<ref>theorem DR2, page 26 of Hughes and Cresswell</ref>
<jh>
stmt (addNecessity () ((p → q)) ((□ p) → (□ q)))
stmt (buildNecessity () ((p ↔ q)) ((□ p) ↔ (□ q)))
</jh>

Similar rules hold for possiblity.<ref>addPossibility is theorem DR3, page 29 of Hughes and Cresswell</ref>
<jh>
stmt (addPossibility () ((p → q)) ((◊ p) → (◊ q)))
stmt (buildPossibility () ((p ↔ q)) ((◊ p) ↔ (◊ q)))
</jh>

Possibility of an implication is equivalent to an implication involving one necessity and one possibility.<ref>exercise 1.1(e), page 17 of Hughes and Cresswell</ref><ref>theorem K7, page 28 of Hughes and Cresswell</ref>
<jh>
stmt (PossibilityNecessityImplication () () ((◊ (p → q)) ↔ ((□ p) → (◊ q))))
</jh>

The rule of necessitation is analogous to the axiom of generalization of [[Interface:First-order logic|predicate logic]].<ref>axiom N, page 20 of Hughes and Cresswell</ref><ref>Necessitation Rule of Garson</ref>
<jh>
stmt (necessitate () (p) (□ p))
</jh>

Necessity and possibility are related by negations<ref><code>NecessityPossibility</code> is theorem K5, page 27 of Hughes and Cresswell and <code>PossibilityNecessity</code> is Def M, page 14 of Hughes and Cresswell. NegationNecessity and NegationPossibility are special cases of LMI on page 28</ref>
<jh>
stmt (NecessityPossibility () () ((□ p) ↔ (¬ (◊ (¬ p)))))
stmt (PossibilityNecessity () () ((◊ p) ↔ (¬ (□ (¬ p)))))

stmt (NegationNecessity () () ((¬ (□ p)) ↔ (◊ (¬ p))))
stmt (NegationPossibility () () ((¬ (◊ p)) ↔ (□ (¬ p))))
</jh>

Possibility distributes or collects across a disjunction.<ref>theorem K6, page 28 of Hughes and Cresswell</ref>
<jh>
stmt (PossibilityDisjunction () () ((◊ (p ∨ q)) ↔ ((◊ p) ∨ (◊ q))))
</jh>
