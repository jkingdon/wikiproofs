[[w:Trigonometry|Trigonometry]] concerns the sine function (and others which can be derived from it, such as cosine, tangent, etc). Here we concern ourselves only with the sine of a real number (not a complex number).

We build on [[Interface:Classical propositional calculus|propositional logic]], [[Interface:First-order logic with quantifiability|first-order logic]], [[Interface:Set theory|set theory]] and [[Interface:Complex number axioms]] (which we are just using for real numbers).

== The sine function ==
In the future, we might prefer to define sin as a function (that is, a set, as will be developed in [[Relations]] when that is more complete) from the reals to the reals, but for now we define it as a term.
<jh>
var (object θ)
term (object (sin object))
stmt (SineRealToReal () () ((θ ∈ (ℝ)) → ((sin θ) ∈ (ℝ))))
