[[w:Trigonometry]] concerns the sine function (and others which can be derived from it, such as cosine, tangent, etc). Here we concern ourselves only with the sine of a real number (not a complex number).

We build on [[Interface:Classical propositional calculus|propositional logic]], [[Interface:First-order logic with quantifiability|first-order logic]], [[Interface:Set theory|set theory]] and [[Interface:Complex number axioms]] (which we are just using for real numbers).
