[[w:Trigonometry|Trigonometry]] concerns the sine function (and others which can be derived from it, such as cosine, tangent, etc). Here we concern ourselves only with the sine of a real number (not a complex number).

We build on [[Interface:Classical propositional calculus|propositional logic]], [[Interface:First-order logic with quantifiability|first-order logic]], [[Interface:Set theory|set theory]] and [[Interface:Complex number axioms]] (which we are just using for real numbers).

== The sine and cosine functions ==
In the future, we might prefer to define sin as a function (that is, a set, as will be developed in [[Relations]] when that is more complete) from the reals to the reals, but for now we define it as a term.
<jh>
var (object α β θ)
term (object (sin object))
stmt (SineRealToReal () () ((θ ∈ (ℝ)) → ((sin θ) ∈ (ℝ))))
</jh>

We define cosine similarly.
<jh>
term (object (cos object))
stmt (CosineRealToReal () () ((θ ∈ (ℝ)) → ((cos θ) ∈ (ℝ))))
</jh>

== Circle constant ==
The circle constant <code>τ</code> is the circumference of a circle divided by its radius.<ref>Landau, Elizabeth (14 March 2011). [http://edition.cnn.com/2011/TECH/innovation/03/14/pi.tau.math/ "On Pi Day, is 'pi' under attack?"]. CNN. Retrieved 15 March 2011</ref>
<jh>
term (object (τ))
</jh>

Some authors instead use a value of <code>τ/2</code>, which they call <code>π</code>.

== Relationship between sine and cosine ==
The sine and the cosine at a given point, squared, add to one, which is the [[w:Pythagorean trigonometric identity|Pythagorean trigonometric identity]].
<jh>
stmt (TrigonometryPythagorean () () ((((sin θ) · (sin θ)) + ((cos θ) · (cos θ))) = (1)))
</jh>

The sine and cosine are the same, shifted by a quarter turn.
<jh>
#stmt (SineShift () () ((sin (θ + ((τ) / (4)))) = (cos θ)))
</jh>

== Periodicity ==
The sine and cosine are periodic with period <code>τ</code> (we do not state, here, that <code>τ</code> is the smallest value which is a period, although it is).
<jh>
stmt (SinePeriod () () ((sin (θ + (τ))) = (sin θ)))
</jh>

== Negation ==
<jh>
#stmt (SineNegation () () ((sin (- θ)) = (- (sin θ))))
</jh>

== Addition ==
There are expressions for taking the sine or cosine of a sum or difference.

<jh>
stmt (SineAddition () () ((sin (α + β)) = (((sin α) · (cos β)) + ((cos α) · (sin β)))))
#stmt (CosineAddition () () ((cos (α + β)) = (((cos α) · (cos β)) − ((cos α) · (sin β)))))
#stmt (SineSubtraction () () ((sin (α − β)) = (((sin α) · (cos β)) − ((cos α) · (sin β)))))
#stmt (CosineSubtraction () () ((cos (α − β)) = (((cos α) · (cos β)) + ((cos α) · (sin β)))))
</jh>
