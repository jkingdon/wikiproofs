This page covers some of the simplest operations of set theory including the empty set, singletons, unordered pairs, power set, and unions. Because of the way that JHilbert currently handles definitions, further development is in other places.

We build on [[Interface:Classical propositional calculus|propositional logic]] and [[Interface:First-order logic with quantifiability|first-order logic]] (including equality):

<jh>
param (CLASSICAL Interface:Classical_propositional_calculus () ())
param (FIRSTORDER Interface:First-order_logic_with_quantifiability (CLASSICAL) ())
</jh>

First-order logic provides us with two kinds: <code>variable</code> is a variable, which represents a set and can be quantified over, and <code>object</code> is an expression which represents a set. For example, a variable might be <code>x</code>, <code>y</code>, or <code>z</code>, but an object could be the singleton <code>{ x }</code>, the unordered pair <code>{ x, y }</code>, the ordered pair <code>〈 x, y 〉</code>, etc. To some extent the concepts of variable and object correspond to set and class in some theories (like metamath's set.mm), but one key difference is that we have no [[w:proper class|proper classes]] thanks to the [[Interface:Axiom of quantifiability|axiom of quantifiability]].

<jh>
var (variable x y z w)
var (object A B C A0 A1 B0 B1)
</jh>

We can test whether one set is an element of another, and define an abbreviation for the negated version.
<jh>
term (formula (∈ object object))
def ((∉ A B) (¬ (A ∈ B)))
</jh>

We assert the existence of the empty set, a set with no elements.
<jh>
term (object (∅))
stmt (EmptySet () () (A ∉ (∅)))
</jh>

Given a set, we can form a set <code>{ s }</code> which has only it as an element.<ref>[http://us.metamath.org/mpeuni/elsncg.html elsncg], metamath's set.mm, accessed August 7, 2010</ref>
<jh>
term (object (singleton object))
stmt (Singleton () () ((A ∈ (singleton B)) ↔ (A = B)))
</jh>

Given two sets, we can form a unordered pair <code>{ s, t }</code> which has only those sets as elements.
<jh>
term (object (unorderedPair object object))
stmt (UnorderedPair () () ((B ∈ (unorderedPair A0 A1)) ↔ ((B = A0) ∨ (B = A1))))
</jh>

We define the subset relationship.
<jh>
term (formula (⊆ object object))
stmt (Subset ((x A) (x B)) ()
  ((A ⊆ B) ↔ (∀ x (((value x) ∈ A) → ((value x) ∈ B)))))
</jh>

The union of a set has as its elements everything which is an element of some set in the given set.
<jh>
term (object (⋃ object))
#stmt (Union ((x A) (x B)) () ((B ∈ (⋃ A)) ↔ (∃ x ((B ∈ (value x)) ∧ ((value x) ∈ A)))))
</jh>

== Builders ==
Equals can be substituted for equals, in the context of set operations.

<jh>
stmt (IsElementBuilderLL () () ((B0 = B1) → ((A ∈ B0) ↔ (A ∈ B1))))
stmt (IsElementBuilderRR () () ((A0 = A1) → ((A0 ∈ B) ↔ (A1 ∈ B))))

stmt (SingletonBuilder () () ((A = B) → ((singleton A) = (singleton B))))

stmt (UnorderedPairBuilder () () (((A0 = B0) ∧ (A1 = B1)) → ((unorderedPair A0 A1) = (unorderedPair B0 B1))))
</jh>

== Extensionality ==
Sets with the same elements are equal.
<jh>
stmt (ExtensionalityObject ((A z) (B z)) () ((∀ z (((value z) ∈ A) ↔ ((value z) ∈ B))) → (A = B)))
</jh>

== To be added ==
Separation (presumably in the form of defining <code>{y ∈ A | φ}</code>). That might go something like <code>B ∈ {y ∈ A | φ} ↔ B ∈ A ∧ [ B / y ] φ</code>.
