A ''[[w:total order|linear order]]'' or ''total order'' has an ordering predicate which lets us compare any two elements for order.

Here we define a linear order in terms of what is called non-strict inequality, or "less than or equal to".

This is a first-order presentation (that is, not built on set theory).

We start by importing propositional and predicate logic.
<jh>
param (PROPOSITIONAL Interface:Classical_propositional_calculus () ())
param (FIRSTORDER Interface:First-order_logic_with_quantifiability (PROPOSITIONAL) ())
</jh>

== Non-strict order ==
There is an order which obeys the usual equality axioms.
<jh>
var (object x y z x0 y0 z0 x1 y1 z1)

term (formula (≤ object object))
stmt (LessEqualBuilder () () (((x0 = x1) ∧ (y0 = y1)) → ((x0 ≤ y0) ↔ (x1 ≤ y1))))
</jh>

It is antisymmetric, transitive, and total.
<jh>
stmt (LessEqualAntisymmetry () () (((x ≤ y) ∧ (y ≤ x)) → (x = y)))
stmt (LessEqualTransitivity () () (((x ≤ y) ∧ (y ≤ z)) → (x ≤ z)))
stmt (LessEqualTotality () () ((x ≤ y) ∨ (y ≤ x)))
</jh>

That is sufficient. These properties imply the theorems in [[Interface:First-order linear order]].
