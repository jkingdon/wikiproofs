The Nicod axioms, named for [[w:Jean Nicod|Jean Nicod]], are an especially spartan axiomatic system for [[w:propositional logic|propositional logic]], yet strong enough to derive all true statements. Nicod introduced it in his article [[s:A Reduction in the number of the Primitive Propositions of Logic|A Reduction in the number of the Primitive Propositions of Logic]].

Nicod makes use of a discovery by [[w:Henry Sheffer|Henry Sheffer]] that all the logical truth functions can be expressed through a single one, the [[w:Sheffer stroke|Sheffer stroke]] <math>\vert</math>, which classically means either [[w:Logical NAND|Logical NAND]] or [[w:Logical NOR|Logical NOR]]. Nicod defines the four classical truth functions negation, implication, disjunction and conjunction in terms of the version of the Sheffer stroke with the NAND meaning.

Let us first define well-formed formulas just as in [[Interface:Principia Mathematica propositional logic|Principia Mathematica]], with <math>p,q,r,s,t</math> as placeholders.
<jh>
kind (wff)
var (wff p q r s t)
</jh>

The basic truth function of the Nicod system is the Sheffer stroke <math>\vert</math>:
<jh>
term (wff (| wff wff))
</jh>
Through the Sheffer stroke, negation <math>\neg</math>, implication <math>\rightarrow</math>, disjunction <math>\vee</math>, and conjunction <math>\wedge</math> can be defined:
<jh>
def ((¬ p) (p | p))
def ((→ p q) (p | (q | q)))
def ((∨ p q) ((p | p) | (q | q)))
def ((∧ p q) ((p | q) | (p | q)))
</jh>
