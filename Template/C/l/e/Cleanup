== Usage ==

<pre>
{{cleanup | message }}
</pre>
Put this template on pages which need cleanup, but for which none of the more specific [[:Category:Cleanup templates|cleanup templates]] applies. It is similar in spirit to [[:Template:Under construction]] but makes it a bit easier to say specifically what is needed.

Using this template automatically places the interface into [[:Category:Pages needing cleanup]].
