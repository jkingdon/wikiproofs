[[Image:Logic.png|left]] The '''[[Principia Mathematica propositional logic]]''' page proves many  [[Interface:Classical propositional calculus|propositional logic theorems]] from axioms.  It is based on ''[[w:Principia Mathematica|Principia Mathematica]]'' by [[w:Alfred North Whitehead|Alfred North Whitehead]] and [[w:Bertrand Russell|Bertrand Russell]].  Published in 1910, ''Principia'' was an attempt to build all of mathematics on a rigorous [[w:Axiom|axiomatic]] basis.  Some parts of its treatment, like the set theory based on [[w:Type theory|type theory]], have not been widely adopted.  Yet a hundred years after its publication, the propositional logic part of the book remains one of the most cited sources for theorems in propositional logic. Its [[Interface:Principia Mathematica propositional logic|axiomatic basis]] consists of two indefinable [[w:logical connective|logical connective]]s, [[w:negation|negation]] and [[w:logical disjunction|disjunction]], five logical [[w:axiom schema|axiom schema]]ta and one rule of detachment, [[w:modus ponens|modus ponens]].
