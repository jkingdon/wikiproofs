[[Image:Logic.png|left]] The '''[[Principia Mathematica propositional logic]]''' page proves many  [[Interface:Classical propositional calculus|propositional logic theorems]] from axioms.  It is based on ''[[w:Principia Mathematica|Principia Mathematica]]'' by Alfred North Whitehead and Bertrand Russell.  Published in 1910, ''Principia'' was an attempt to build all of mathematics on a rigorous [[w:Axiom|axiomatic]] basis.  Some parts of its treatment, like the set theory based on [[w:Type theory|type theory]], have not been widely adopted.  Yet a hundred years after its publication, the propositional logic part of the book remains one of the most cited sources for theorems in propositional logic.
