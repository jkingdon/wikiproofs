This is a draft of a short blurb on wikiproofs.

Did you always want to take things apart to figure out how they work? Wikiproofs.org lets students (and other interested people) do this with formal mathematical proofs, and also try their hand at writing proofs, which are checked by an automated proof verifier. The proof language is inspired by Norman Megill's metamath, and, like metamath, does not require the reader to guess how any step was performed. Putting the proofs on a wiki enables anyone to contribute and also provides the ability to mix formal proofs with explanatory text, figures, references to sources, and links to other pages on the site. Opportunities for contributing to wikiproofs include fleshing out the mathematical content, improving the existing proofs or their presentation, working on the proof verification software itself, and writing documentation.

The proof verifier is modular: each page decides which axioms, or previously proved results, to import. This lets different theories (which need not be consistent with each other) coexist on the website, and also makes it possible to start from different starting points: the axioms of set theory and logic, or any other starting point which can be expressed as a set of axioms. Wikiproofs currently has well-developed pages for propositional logic, predicate logic, and Peano arithmetic and a good start on geometry and set theory. 
Computer-verified proofs, and their use in education, are still in their infancy. Will opening up the system to wiki-style collaboration unleash the same creative burst that we have seen in other online collaborations? Only time will tell.
