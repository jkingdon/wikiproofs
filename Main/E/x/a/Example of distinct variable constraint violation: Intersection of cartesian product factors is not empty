The easiest way to get some statements to work with is going to be to import one of our existing interfaces; here we pick [[Interface:First-order logic]].
<jh>
import (PROPOSITIONAL Interface:Classical_propositional_calculus () ())
import (FIRST Interface:First-order_logic (PROPOSITIONAL) ())
</jh>

The important thing from that file is:
 stmt (Generalization ((x φ)) () (φ → (∀ x φ)))

Here's a valid proof:

<jh>
var (variable x y)
thm (valid ((x y)) () (((value x) = (value x)) → (∀ y ((value x) = (value x)))) (
        ((value x) = (value x)) y Generalization
))
</jh>

Here's one which violates the distinct variable constraint, because the variable x appears in both the formula <code>x = x</code> and the variable.  {{error expected|Distinct variable constraint violation: Intersection of cartesian product factors is not empty}}

<jh>
thm (invalid () () (((value x) = (value x)) → (∀ x ((value x) = (value x)))) (
        ((value x) = (value x)) x Generalization
))
</jh>
