The easiest way to get some statements to work with is going to be to import one of our existing interfaces; here we pick [[Interface:Classical_propositional_calculus]].
<jh>
import (PROPOSITIONAL Interface:Classical_propositional_calculus () ())
</jh>

The only statement we care about from that file is:
 stmt (AntecedentIntroduction () () (p → (q → p)))

Here's a valid proof:

<jh>
var (formula r s)
thm (valid () () (r → (s → r)) (
        r s AntecedentIntroduction
))
</jh>

Here's one which produces a statement which does not have the right form.  It will blow up with an error message, probably "Consequent of theorem does not match proof result".

<jh>
thm (invalid () () ((r → s) → r) (
        r s AntecedentIntroduction
))
</jh>
