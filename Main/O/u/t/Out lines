This is part of a series of modules which prove a variety of geometrical theorems starting with Tarski's axioms for geometry. We follow the formalization of Julien Narboux<ref>The formal proofs are at [http://www.lix.polytechnique.fr/Labo/Julien.Narboux/tarski.html Formalization of Tarski's geometry in the Coq proof assistant] and are described in Julien Narboux (2007), "[http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.158.8614 Mechanical Theorem Proving in Tarski’s Geometry]", F. Botana and T. Recio (Eds.): ADG 2006, LNAI 4869, pp. 139–156</ref> which itself closely follows a treatise by Schwabhäuser, Szmielew, and Tarski.<ref>W. Schwabhäuser, W Szmielew, and A. Tarski (1983), ''Metamathematische Methoden in der Geometrie'', ISBN 0387129588</ref>

This page gets its name from ''out lines'', that is a predicate <code>(P is-outside A B)</code> which means that <code>P</code> is on the line <code>A B</code> outside the segment <code>A B</code>. We prove a number of results based on that concept, which in turn lead to a number of theorems involving collinearity.

We import the theorems of [[Interface:Classical propositional calculus|propositional logic]] and [[Interface:First-order logic with quantifiability|predicate logic]], and the [[Interface:Line segment inequality|geometry results so far]] and define some variables:

import (CLASSICAL Interface:Classical_propositional_calculus () ())

import (START Interface:Line_segment_inequality (CLASSICAL FIRSTORDER) ())

== Out lines defined ==
A point <code>P</code> is on the line <code>A B</code> outside the line segment <code>A B</code> if and only if one of those points is between <code>P</code> and the other and <code>P</code> is not equal to either one.<ref>Definition out in Narboux</ref>
<jh>
def ((is-outside P A B) (((A ≠ P) ∧ (B ≠ P)) ∧ ((between P A B) ∨ (between P B A))))
</jh>

We also state this definition as a theorem.
<jh>
thm (OutBetweenness () () ((P is-outside A B) ↔ (((A ≠ P) ∧ (B ≠ P)) ∧ ((between P A B) ∨ (between P B A)))) (
        (P is-outside A B) BiconditionalReflexivity

=== Relating out lines to existence of a point beyond the outside point ===
This section (and the next one) have to do with relating <code>P is-outside A B</code> to a point <code>C</code> for which <code>between A P C</code> and <code>between B P C</code>. The first result says that if <code>between A P C</code>, then <code>between B P C</code> is equivalent to <code>P is-outside A B</code>.<ref>l6_2 in Narboux</ref>

We first tackle the <code>between B P C → P is-outside A B</code> case. This is a straightforward application of <code>BetweennessMiddleConnectivity</code>, which in this case says basically that <code>between A P C</code> and <code>between B P C</code> imply <code>between A B P ∨ between B A P</code>.
<jh>
thm (BeyondOutForward () () ((((((A ≠ P) ∧ (B ≠ P)) ∧ (C ≠ P)) ∧ (between A P C)) ∧ (between B P C)) → (P is-outside A B)) (
</jh>
The first two parts of the <code>P is-outside A B</code> definition are the inequalities <code>A ≠ P</code> and <code>B ≠ P</code> which we just carry over from the antecedent.

        ((((A ≠ P) ∧ (B ≠ P)) ∧ (C ≠ P)) ∧ (between A P C))

        eliminateRightConjunctInConsequent
        eliminateRightConjunctInConsequent
        eliminateLeftConjunctInConsequent

        composeConjunction
</jh>
To apply <code>BetweennessMiddleConnectivity</code>, we first need <code>C ≠ P</code>.
<jh>
        ((((A ≠ P) ∧ (B ≠ P)) ∧ (C ≠ P)) ∧ (between A P C))
          (between B P C)
          ConjunctionRightElimination
        eliminateRightConjunctInConsequent
        eliminateLeftConjunctInConsequent
</jh>
Next we need <code>between C P A</code>.
<jh>
        ((((A ≠ P) ∧ (B ≠ P)) ∧ (C ≠ P)) ∧ (between A P C))
          (between B P C)

        A P C BetweennessSymmetry
        eliminateBiconditionalReverse
        applySyllogism

        composeConjunction
</jh>
The last thing we will need for <code>BetweennessMiddleConnectivity</code> is <code>between C P B</code>.
<jh>
        ((((A ≠ P) ∧ (B ≠ P)) ∧ (C ≠ P)) ∧ (between A P C))
          (between B P C)

        B P C BetweennessSymmetry
        eliminateBiconditionalReverse
        applySyllogism

        composeConjunction
</jh>
Now we apply connectivity to get <code>between P A B ∨ between P B A</code>, which is the only remaining part of the definition of <code>is-outside</code>.
<jh>
        C P A B BetweennessMiddleConnectivity
        applySyllogism

        composeConjunction
))

</jh>
In the other direction, <code>P is-outside A B</code> tells us that either <code>between P A B</code> or <code>between P B A</code>. In the either case, we can apply transitivity with <code>between A P C</code> to get <code>between B P C</code>.

We'll arrange this proof by first rearranging the disjunction and conjunctions, before we worry about transitivity.
<jh>
thm (BeyondOutReverse-1 () ()
  ((((((A ≠ P) ∧ (B ≠ P)) ∧ (C ≠ P)) ∧ (between A P C)) ∧ (P is-outside A B)) →
    ((((A ≠ P) ∧ (between A P C)) ∧ (between P A B)) ∨
      (((A ≠ P) ∧ (between A P C)) ∧ (between P B A)))) (
</jh>
First we pick out <code>A ≠ P ∧ between A P C</code>.
<jh>
        ((((A ≠ P) ∧ (B ≠ P)) ∧ (C ≠ P)) ∧ (between A P C))
          (P is-outside A B)

          ConjunctionRightElimination
        eliminateLeftConjunctInConsequent

        composeConjunction
</jh>
Next we take <code>P is-outside A B</code>, unfold the definition, and extract <code>between P A B ∨ between P B A</code>.
<jh>
        ((((A ≠ P) ∧ (B ≠ P)) ∧ (C ≠ P)) ∧ (between A P C))

Applying distributivity of conjunction over disjunction finishes the job.

Our first transitivity invocation is <code>between B A P ∧ between A P C ∧ A ≠ P → between B P C</code>.

=== The existence of a point beyond the outside point ===
In this section we show that a point is outside a line segment if and only if there exists a point beyond the outside point.  In symbols, <code>P is-outside A B</code> is equivalent to <code>A ≠ P ∧ B ≠ P ∧ ∃ c (C ≠ P ∧ between A P C ∧ between B P C)</code>.

We start with the forward implication. Extend <code>A P</code> to a distinct point <code>c</code> (that is, a point for which <code>P ≠ c ∧ between A P c</code>. We can then apply <code>BeyondOut</code> to show that <code>between B P c</code>.<ref>l6_3_1 in Narboux</ref> Below we present the formal version of this proof, broken down into several lemmas.

<jh>
thm (ExistsBeyondOutForward-bpc () ()
  (((P is-outside A B) ∧ ((C ≠ P) ∧ (between A P C))) →
    (between B P C)) (
</jh>
At the end of the proof we'll need a copy of <code>P is-outside A B</code>, so we stick it on the proof stack.
<jh>
        (P is-outside A B) ((C ≠ P) ∧ (between A P C)) ConjunctionRightElimination
</jh>
Most of the proof of this lemma consists of an application of  <code>BeyondOut</code>. The first thing we need is <code>A ≠ P</code>.

Applying <code>BeyondOut</code> gives us <code>between B P C ↔ P is-outside A B</code>
<jh>
        A P B C BeyondOut
        applySyllogism
</jh>
Now we detach the <code>P is-outside A B</code> part so we just have <code>between B P C</code>.

The next lemma is just <code>PointConstructionDifferent</code>, together with some rearrangements via commutativity and symmetry.

        export
        c addForAllToConsequent
</jh>
We now have <code>P is-outside A B → ∀ c (c ≠ P ∧ between A P c → between B P c)</code>. Combining this with the previous result gives <code>P is-outside A B → ∃ c (c ≠ P ∧ between A P c ∧ (c ≠ P ∧ between A P c → between B P c))</code>.

To get <code>between B P c</code> is just a matter of modus ponens. The one complication is that we want to keep <code>c ≠ P ∧ between A P c</code> around in addition, so we apply idempotence, associativity, and modus ponens, in that order.

=== Alternate definition in terms of collinearity ===
A point is outside a line segment if and only if it is collinear with the endpoints of the segment but not between them. That is, <code>P is-outside A B ↔ collinear A P B ∧ ¬ between A P B</code>.

We first tackle the forward direction.<ref>l6_4_1 in Narboux</ref> The first lemma is <code>P ≠ A ∧ P ≠ B ∧ between P A B → ¬ between A P B</code>.
<jh>
thm (OutCollinearityForward-1 () () ((((A ≠ P) ∧ (B ≠ P)) ∧ (between P A B)) → (¬ (between A P B))) (

The second lemma, <code>A ≠ P ∧ B ≠ P ∧ between P B A → ¬ between A P B</code>, is very similar.
<jh>

Combining the two previous lemmas we get <code>P is-outside A B → ¬ between A P B</code>.

thm (OutCollinearityForward-3 () () ((P is-outside A B) → (¬ (between A P B))) (

Combining the last two results gives the forward direction.

</jh>

Turning our attention to the reverse direction,<ref>l6_4_2 in Narboux</ref> we have two tasks. The first is to show that <code>P ≠ A</code> and </code>P ≠ B</code>, each of which follows from <code>¬ between A P B</code> (because either equality holding would make <code>between A P B</code> hold trivially).
<jh>
thm (OutCollinearityReverse-1 () () (((collinear A P B) ∧ (¬ (between A P B))) → ((A ≠ P) ∧ (B ≠ P))) (

== Reflexive, symmetric, and transitive ==
Here we present versions of reflexivity, symmetry, and transitivity. You can think of this as dividing a line (excluding the point <code>P</code> itself) into two equivalence classes: those to the left of <code>P</code> and those to the right (we certainly don't have the machinery to say it quite that way, but that is the rough idea).

=== Reflexivity ===

        buildConjunction
))
</jh>

=== Transitivity ===
Expanding the definitions of the antecedent, we start with
  A ≠ P ∧ B ≠ P ∧ (between P A B ∨ between P B A) ∧
  B ≠ P ∧ C ≠ P ∧ (between P B C ∨ between P C B)
Looking at the betweenness part of that, there are four cases (<code>between P A B ∧ between P B C</code> being the first, <code>between P A B ∧ between P C B</code>, being the second, and so on).

The interesting part is a lemma which handles those four cases; there is also a fair bit of rearranging (in the lemma and in the proof of the actual theorem).

<jh>
thm (OutTransitivity-1 () () (((B ≠ P) ∧
  (((between P A B) ∨ (between P B A)) ∧
    ((between P B C) ∨ (between P C B)))) →
  ((between P A C) ∨ (between P C A))) (
</jh>
First we break down the four cases.

Now we distribute the <code>B ≠ P</code> into each of the cases.
<jh>
        (B ≠ P)
          (((between P A B) ∧ (between P B C)) ∨ ((between P A B) ∧ (between P C B)))

        disjoin
        applySyllogism
</jh>
The first case is <code>B ≠ P ∧ between P A B ∧ between P B C</code>.  In all four cases we are showing that the case in question implies <code>between P A C ∨ between P C A</code>. In the current case, <code>between P A C</code> follows from transitivity.

First we pick out <code>A ≠ P</code>.
<jh>
        (((A ≠ P) ∧ (B ≠ P)) ∧ ((between P A B) ∨ (between P B A)))

== Line segment construction ==
From a given point, in the direction of a second given point, we construct a segment congruent to a given line segment. This is similar to <code>InnerSegmentConstruction</code> but is expressed in terms of <code>is-outside</code>.

=== Existence ===
In this section we prove the existence of such a point. That is, <code>R ≠ A ∧ B ≠ C → ∃ e (A is-outside e R ∧ A e ≡ B C)</code>.

The proof consists of applying <code>InnerSegmentConstruction</code>, rearranging, and applying the definition of <code>is-outside</code>. The following lemma expresses most of the rearrangements.<ref>l6_11_existence in Narboux</ref>
<jh>
thm (OutSegmentConstructionLemma () ()
  ((((R ≠ A) ∧ (B ≠ C)) ∧
    (((between A R E) ∨ (between A E R)) ∧
      (A E ≡ B C))) →
  ((A is-outside E R) ∧ (A E ≡ B C))) (
</jh>
To apply the definition of <code>A is-outside E R</code>, first we need <code>E ≠ A</code>. This follows from <code>B ≠ C</code> and <code>A E ≡ B C</code>, and the first step is picking out those two formulas.
<jh>
        ((R ≠ A) ∧ (B ≠ C))
          (((between A R E) ∨ (between A E R)) ∧
            (A E ≡ B C))

        eliminateLeftConjunctInConsequent

        ((R ≠ A) ∧ (B ≠ C))
          (((between A R E) ∨ (between A E R)) ∧
            (A E ≡ B C))
          ConjunctionLeftElimination
        eliminateLeftConjunctInConsequent

        composeConjunction
</jh>
The next step in getting to <code>E ≠ A</code> is to show that <code>B ≠ C ∧ A E ≡ B C → A ≠ E</code>.
<jh>
        A E B C CongruenceIdentityFromEquality
        export
        applyComm

        eliminateBiconditionalReverse
        applySyllogism

        applyComm
        import
</jh>
Combining that with the previous result and flipping the two sides of the not-equals sign gives us <code>E ≠ A</code>.
<jh>
        applySyllogism

        A E EqualitySymmetry
        addNegation
        eliminateBiconditionalReverse
        applySyllogism
</jh>
Next we need <code>R ≠ A</code>.
<jh>
        ((R ≠ A) ∧ (B ≠ C))
          (((between A R E) ∨ (between A E R)) ∧
            (A E ≡ B C))
          ConjunctionRightElimination
        eliminateRightConjunctInConsequent

        composeConjunction
</jh>
Then we need <code>between A E R ∨ between A R E</code>
<jh>
        ((R ≠ A) ∧ (B ≠ C))
          (((between A R E) ∨ (between A E R)) ∧
            (A E ≡ B C))

That's all for <code>A is-outside E R</code>. So the only remaining step is <code>A E ≡ B C</code>

        ((R ≠ A) ∧ (B ≠ C))

=== Uniqueness ===
The point that we construct this way is also unique. In symbols, <code>R ≠ A ∧ B ≠ C ∧ A is-outside X R ∧ A X ≡ B C ∧ A is-outside Y R ∧ A Y ≡ B C → X = Y</code>.<ref>l6_11_unicity in Narboux</ref>

The proof of uniqueness is more involved than the existence proof. Start by expanding the definitions of <code>is-outside</code> (and removing the redundant copies of <code>R ≠ A</code>) so we now have
  R ≠ A ∧ B ≠ C ∧
  X ≠ A ∧ (between A X R ∨ between A R X) ∧
  A X ≡ B C ∧
  Y ≠ A ∧ (between A Y R ∨ between A R Y) ∧
  A Y ≡ B C

By congruence transitivity, we derive <code>A X ≡ A Y</code>. Then we look at the betweenness relationships. Specifically we want to conclude <code>between A X Y ∨ between A Y X</code>. There are four cases: <code>between A X R ∧ between A Y R → between A X Y ∨ between A Y X</code> by inner connectivity, <code>between A X R ∧ between A R Y → between A X Y</code> by transitivity, <code>between A R X ∧ between A Y R → between A Y X</code> by transitivity, and <code>A ≠ R ∧ between A R X ∧ between A R Y → between A X Y ∨ between A Y X</code> by outer connectivity.

Once we have <code>A X ≡ A Y</code> and <code>between A X Y ∨ between A Y X</code>, <code>X = Y</code> follows from <code>BetweennessOneDistanceUniqueness</code> (applied twice, once to each of the betweenness formulas).

Our first lemma just spells out the four cases.
<jh>
thm (OutSegmentConstructionUniqueness-cases () () 
  (((((((R ≠ A) ∧ (B ≠ C)) ∧
    (A is-outside X R)) ∧ (A X ≡ B C)) ∧

  ((((between A X R) ∧ (between A Y R)) ∨

Now we distribute the <code>A ≠ R</code> into each of the cases.

          (((between A X R) ∧ (between A Y R)) ∨ ((between A X R) ∧ (between A R Y)))

== The closer point is between ==
If <code>A</code> and <code>B</code> are on a line with <code>P</code>, both on the same side of <code>P</code>, and <code>A</code> is closer to <code>P</code> than <code>B</code> is, then <code>A</code> is between <code>P</code> and <code>B</code>. That is, <code>P is-outside A B ∧ P A ≤ P B → between P A B</code>.<ref>l6_13_1 in Narboux</ref>

The proof begins by expanding <code>P A ≤ P B</code> to <code>∃ y (between P y B ∧ P A ≡ P y)</code>. From <code>P is-outside A B</code> and <code>P A ≡ P y</code> we can conclude <code>P ≠ y</code>. We will then be applying <code>OutSegmentConstructionUniqueness</code> which in this case expands to:

  B ≠ P ∧ P ≠ y ∧
  P is-outside y B ∧ P y ≡ P y ∧
  P is-outside A B ∧ P A ≡ P y →
  y = A

Each piece of this is something we already have, or readily follows from things we have. Once we have <code>y = A</code> we just substitute it into <code>between P y B</code> and we are done.

The converse also holds: <code>P is-outside A B ∧ between P A B → P A ≤ P B</code>.<ref>l6_13_2 in Narboux</ref> To prove <code>P A ≤ P B</code>, we need <code>∃ c (between P c B ∧ P A ≡ P c)</code>, and the point <code>A</code> suffices for the choice of <code>c</code>.

== Collinearity ==
In this section we prove a number of results involving collinearity.

=== Outer transitivity ===
Here we prove <code>P ≠ Q ∧ collinear P Q A ∧ collinear P Q B → collinear P A B</code>.<ref>col_transitivity_1 in Narboux</ref>

Actually, we first prove it in the slightly rearranged form <code>P ≠ Q ∧ collinear S P Q ∧ collinear X P Q → collinear X P S</code> (in which <code>P</code> and <code>Q</code> are interchanged and the order of the points in the collinearity statements are chagned). There is no deep reason for this rearrangement, but it will be slightly more convenient in the next section.

Expanding each <code>collinear</code> in the antecedent by the definition, and then applying associativity, gives us nine cases. In each case we'll be able to prove <code>between X P S</code>, <code>between P X S</code>, <code>between P S X</code>, or a disjunction between two of them. Each case will follow from either betweenness transitivity or betweenness connectivity.

We start with a lemma, and then proceed to the proof.
<jh>
thm (CollinearityCollinearity-1 () ()
  (((between P S X) ∨ (between P X S)) → (collinear X P S)) (

Sorry breaking out the cases took so long. Anyway, we are ready to tackle them one by one. The first is <code>between S P Q ∧ between X P Q</code> (of course, all of them have <code>P ≠ Q</code> tacked on the front, which we usually will not state explicitly). It follows from the following application of <code>BetweennessMiddleConnectivity</code>: <code>Q ≠ P ∧ between Q P S ∧ between Q P X → between P S X ∨ between P X S</code>

=== Being collinear to collinear points ===
Given three collinear distinct points, a fourth point being collinear to two of them is equivalent to being collinear to two others. More precisely, <code>P ≠ Q ∧ S ≠ P ∧ collinear S P Q → (collinear X P Q ↔ collinear X P S)</code>.

The forward direction is <code>P ≠ Q ∧ S ≠ P ∧ collinear S P Q ∧ collinear X P Q → collinear X P S</code>.<ref>l6_16_1 in Narboux</ref> It is almost identical to what we proved in the previous section (we just need to drop the <code>S ≠ P</code>).

The reverse direction is <code>P ≠ Q ∧ S ≠ P ∧ collinear S P Q ∧ collinear X P S → collinear X P Q</code>.<ref>l6_16_2 in Narboux</ref> This is essentially the same as the forward direction, as exchanging <code>S</code> and <code>Q</code> doesn't really change the statement. Narboux proves the reverse direction by copy-pasting the proof of the forward direction, interchanging <code>S</code> and <code>Q</code>, but our proof simply performs the right rearrangements to apply the forward direction.
