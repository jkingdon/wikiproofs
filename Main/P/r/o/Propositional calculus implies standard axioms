In order to avoid duplicating a lot of the work in [[Principia Mathematica propositional logic]], we'll just import [[Interface:Classical propositional calculus]].  Since [[Principia Mathematica propositional logic]] proves that interface from the ''Principia'' axioms, this is equivalent to importing the ''Principia'' axioms.

<jh>
import (CLASSICAL Interface:Classical_propositional_calculus () ())
var (formula p q r)
</jh>

The first axiom, ''Simp'', is called <code>AntecedentIntroduction</code> in [[Interface:Classical propositional calculus]].
<jh>
thm (Simp () () (p → (q → p)) (
        p q AntecedentIntroduction
))
</jh>

The second axiom, ''Frege'', is one direction of <code>AntecedentDistribution</code> from [[Interface:Classical propositional calculus]].

<jh>
thm (Frege () () ((p → (q → r)) → ((p → q) → (p → r))) (
        p q r AntecedentDistribution eliminateBiconditionalReverse
))
</jh>

The third axiom, ''Transp'', is one direction of <code>Transposition</code> from [[Interface:Classical propositional calculus]].
<jh>
thm (Transp () () (((¬ p) → (¬ q)) → (q → p)) (
        q p Transposition eliminateBiconditionalForward
))
</jh>

The inference rule, <code>applyModusPonens</code>, is the same in the two sets of axioms (and has the same name), so we don't need to do anything.

<jh>
export (STANDARD Interface:Standard_axioms_of_propositional_logic () ())
</jh>
