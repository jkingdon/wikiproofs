We import some interfaces and define some variables:
<jh>
import (PROPOSITIONAL Interface:Classical_propositional_calculus () ())
import (AXIOMS Interface:Axioms_of_first-order_logic_as_set_forth_in_metamath_problem_17 (PROPOSITIONAL) ())

var (formula φ ψ χ θ φx φy φs ψy antecedent)
var (object s t u s0 s1 t0 t1)
var (variable x y z x0 x1 y0 y1)
</jh>

The purpose of this page is to figure out whether the axioms at [[Interface:Axioms of first-order logic as set forth in metamath problem 17]] are a sufficient set of axioms for first-order logic, as set forth in [[Interface:Axioms of first-order logic]]. We try to mostly follow a similar course of action as in [[First-order logic in terms of substitution built on equality]].

== A few rules based on axioms ==
Here is a rule form of <code>stdpc4</code>.
<jh>
thm (specializeToVariable () ((H (∀ x φ))) (subst (value y) x φ) (
        H
        x φ y stdpc4
        applyModusPonens
))
</jh>

== Existential quantification ==
In [[Interface:Axioms of first-order logic as set forth in metamath problem 17]] we defined <code>∃ x φ</code> as <code>¬ ∀ x ¬ φ</code>. Here are a few easy consequences.
<jh>
thm (NotThereExists () () ((¬ (∃ x φ)) ↔ (∀ x (¬ φ))) (
        x φ df-ex
        addNegation

        (∀ x (¬ φ)) DoubleNegation swapBiconditional
        applyBiconditionalTransitivity
))

# Need buildForAll or some equivalent, like Margaris' replacement theorem
#thm (NotForAll () () ((¬ (∀ x φ)) ↔ (∃ x (¬ φ))) (
#        φ DoubleNegation
#        x buildForAll
#        addNegation
#))
</jh>

== What next? ==
{{cleanup|figuring out where to start}}
TRY#2
* variable is effectively not free in a theorem
* specialize a theorem (HOW?)
* x = x as theorem
* stdpc7

TRY#3
* turn dfsb7 into some version of SubstItself
φ |- ∀ x ¬ ¬ φ
φ |- φ → ∀ x ¬ ¬ φ
φ |- ¬ ∀ x ¬ ¬ φ → ¬ φ

TRY#3a
* Start out with some ∃ theorems? Look at [[First-order logic]] for ideas.

== Substitution of a variable for itself ==
We start with being able to substitute a variable for itself. The ability to remove such a substitution follows directly from our axioms (?).
<jh>
#thm (SubstItselfRemove () () ((subst (value x) x φ) → φ) (
#        x stdpc6
#))
</jh>

== Metamath axiomization of first-order logic ==
Once we are done, here we would export the metamath axioms, or rather the versions stated at [[Interface:Axioms of first-order logic]].

<jh>
#export (METAMATH Interface:Axioms_of_first-order_logic (PROPOSITIONAL) ())
</jh>
