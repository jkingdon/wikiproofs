We import some interfaces and define some variables:
<jh>
import (PROPOSITIONAL Interface:Classical_propositional_calculus () ())
import (AXIOMS Interface:Axioms_of_first-order_logic_as_set_forth_in_metamath_problem_17 (PROPOSITIONAL) ())

var (formula φ ψ χ θ φx φy φs ψy antecedent)
var (object s t u s0 s1 t0 t1)
var (variable x y z x0 x1 y0 y1)
</jh>

The purpose of this page is to figure out whether the axioms at [[Interface:Axioms of first-order logic as set forth in metamath problem 17]] are a sufficient set of axioms for first-order logic, as set forth in [[Interface:Axioms of first-order logic]]. We try to mostly follow a similar course of action as in [[First-order logic in terms of substitution built on equality]].

== A few rules based on axioms ==
Here is a rule form of <code>stdpc4</code>.
<jh>
thm (specializeToVariable () ((H (∀ x φ))) (subst (value y) x φ) (
        H
        x φ y stdpc4
        applyModusPonens
))
</jh>

== Distributing for-all across an implication ==
At least for now, we adopted <code>∀ x (φ → ψ) → (∀ x φ → ∀ x ψ)</code> as an axiom. Here are some consequences of that.
<jh>
thm (addForAll () ((H (φ → ψ))) ((∀ x φ) → (∀ x ψ)) (
        H
        x ax-gen

        x φ ψ ForAllImplication

        applyModusPonens
))

thm (buildForAll () ((H (φ ↔ ψ))) ((∀ x φ) ↔ (∀ x ψ)) (
        H eliminateBiconditionalReverse x addForAll
        H eliminateBiconditionalForward x addForAll
        introduceBiconditionalFromImplications
))
</jh>

== Existential quantification ==
In [[Interface:Axioms of first-order logic as set forth in metamath problem 17]] we defined <code>∃ x φ</code> as <code>¬ ∀ x ¬ φ</code>. Here are a few easy consequences.
<jh>
thm (NotThereExists () () ((¬ (∃ x φ)) ↔ (∀ x (¬ φ))) (
        x φ df-ex
        addNegation

        (∀ x (¬ φ)) DoubleNegation swapBiconditional
        applyBiconditionalTransitivity
))

thm (NotForAll () () ((¬ (∀ x φ)) ↔ (∃ x (¬ φ))) (
        φ DoubleNegation
        x buildForAll
        addNegation

        x (¬ φ) df-ex
        swapBiconditional
        applyBiconditionalTransitivity
))
</jh>

=== Adding there exists to both sides of an implication ===
Here we prove <code>∀ x (φ → ψ) → (∃ x φ → ∃ x ψ)</code>.
<jh>
thm (ForAllImplicationThereExists () () ((∀ x (φ → ψ)) → ((∃ x φ) → (∃ x ψ))) (
</jh>
We start by changing <code>φ → ψ</code> to <code>¬ ψ → ¬ φ</code>
<jh>
        φ ψ Transposition
        eliminateBiconditionalReverse
        x addForAll
</jh>
Then we distribute the quantifier across <code>¬ ψ → ¬ φ</code> and transpose to get <code>¬ ∀ x ¬ φ → ¬ ∀ x ¬ ψ</code>.
<jh>
        x (¬ ψ) (¬ φ) ForAllImplication
        applySyllogism

        introduceTranspositionInConsequent
</jh>
Now we just need to apply the definition of <code>∃</code>.
<jh>
        x φ df-ex
        x ψ df-ex
        buildImplication

        eliminateBiconditionalForward
        applySyllogism
))
</jh>

A consequence are builders for <code>∃</code>:
<jh>
thm (addThereExists () ((H (φ → ψ))) ((∃ x φ) → (∃ x ψ)) (
        H
        x ax-gen

        x φ ψ ForAllImplicationThereExists

        applyModusPonens
))

thm (buildThereExists () ((H (φ ↔ ψ))) ((∃ x φ) ↔ (∃ x ψ)) (
        H eliminateBiconditionalReverse x addThereExists
        H eliminateBiconditionalForward x addThereExists
        introduceBiconditionalFromImplications
))
</jh>

TRY#2
* variable is effectively not free in a theorem
* specialize a theorem (HOW?)
* x = x as theorem
* stdpc7

TRY#3
* turn dfsb7 into some version of SubstItself
φ ⊢ ∀ x ¬ ¬ φ
φ ⊢ φ → ∀ x ¬ ¬ φ
φ ⊢ ¬ ∀ x ¬ ¬ φ → ¬ φ

TRY#3a
* Start out with some ∃ theorems? Look at [[First-order logic]] for ideas.

doubling?
stmt (stdpc5 () ((φ → (∀ x φ))) ((∀ x (φ → ψ)) → (φ → (∀ x ψ))))
φ → (∀ x φ) ⊢ ∀ x (φ → ∀ x φ) → (φ → ∀ x ∀ x φ)
∀ x φ → ∀ x ∀ x φ ⊢ ∀ x (∀ x φ → ψ) → (∀ x φ → ∀ x ψ)

ThereExistsIntroductionFromVariable?
  depends on SubstNegation

SubstNegation?
  [ y / x ] ¬ φ ↔ ∃ z (z = y ∧ ∃ x (x = z ∧ ¬ φ))
  ¬ [ y / x ] φ ↔ ¬ ∃ z (z = y ∧ ∃ x (x = z ∧ φ))
    ↔ ∀ z ¬ (z = y ∧ ∃ x (x = z ∧ φ))
stmt (dfsb7 () () ((subst (value y) x φ) ↔
  (∃ z (((value z) = (value y)) ∧ (∃ x (((value x) = (value z)) ∧ φ))))))

== Substitution of a variable for itself ==
We start with being able to substitute a variable for itself. The ability to remove such a substitution follows directly from our axioms (? - seems to need ∀ x x = x → x = x which we don't have yet).
<jh>
#thm (SubstItselfRemove () () ((subst (value x) x φ) → φ) (
#        x stdpc6
#))
</jh>

== Metamath axiomization of first-order logic ==
Once we are done, here we would export the metamath axioms, or rather the versions stated at [[Interface:Axioms of first-order logic]].

<jh>
#export (METAMATH Interface:Axioms_of_first-order_logic (PROPOSITIONAL) ())
</jh>
