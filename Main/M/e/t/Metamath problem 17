We import some interfaces and define some variables:
<jh>
import (PROPOSITIONAL Interface:Classical_propositional_calculus () ())
import (AXIOMS Interface:Axioms_of_first-order_logic_as_set_forth_in_metamath_problem_17 (PROPOSITIONAL) ())

var (formula φ ψ χ θ φx φy φs ψy antecedent)
var (object s t u s0 s1 t0 t1)
var (variable x y z x0 x1 y0 y1)
</jh>

The purpose of this page is to figure out whether the axioms at [[Interface:Axioms of first-order logic as set forth in metamath problem 17]] are a sufficient set of axioms for first-order logic, as set forth in [[Interface:Axioms of first-order logic]]. We try to mostly follow a similar course of action as in [[First-order logic in terms of substitution built on equality]].

== A few rules based on axioms ==
Here is a rule form of <code>stdpc4</code>.
<jh>
thm (specializeToVariable () ((H (∀ x φ))) (subst (value y) x φ) (
        H
        x φ y stdpc4
        applyModusPonens
))
</jh>

== Metamath axiomization of first-order logic ==
Once we are done, here we would export the metamath axioms, or rather the versions stated at [[Interface:Axioms of first-order logic]].

<jh>
#export (METAMATH Interface:Axioms_of_first-order_logic (PROPOSITIONAL) ())
</jh>
