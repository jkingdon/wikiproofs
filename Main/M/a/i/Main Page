'''[[Wikiproofs:About|Wikiproofs]]''' is an online repository of [[Wikiproofs:Copyrights|free]] [[w:formal system|formalisations]]. It is possible to [[w:deductive reasoning|reason]] within such a formalisation, that is, to put forth statements and write formal proofs for some of them. These proofs are immediately verified upon submission by an automated proof verifier. The largest domain of formal reasoning is [[w:mathematics|mathematics]], but Wikiproof's underlying proof verifier is sufficiently generic to allow for other formal systems as well.
