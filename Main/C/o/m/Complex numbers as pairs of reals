A complex number can be broken into two real numbers: a real part and an imaginary part. Here we construct the complex numbers from the reals in this way.

We import [[Interface:Classical propositional calculus]], [[Interface:First-order logic with quantifiability]], and [[Interface:Set theory]]. We also import [[Interface:Real number axioms]] and define some variables:
<jh>
import (PROPOSITIONAL Interface:Classical_propositional_calculus () ())
import (FIRSTORDER Interface:First-order_logic_with_quantifiability (PROPOSITIONAL) ())
import (SETS Interface:Set_theory (PROPOSITIONAL FIRSTORDER) ())

import (REALS Interface:Real_number_axioms (PROPOSITIONAL FIRSTORDER SETS) ())
</jh>

== Complex numbers ==
We start by defining the set of complex numbers, <code>ℂ</code>, as <code>ℝ × ℝ</code>. Everything we will be exporting to [[Interface:Complex number axioms]] is prefixed with <code>complex.</code> We need to make this distinction to avoid naming conflicts. In particular, <code>ℝ</code> is the set of real numbers we started with, but <code>complex.ℝ</code> is a subset of <code>ℝ × ℝ</code>, containing those numbers with imaginary part zero.
