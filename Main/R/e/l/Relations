We first import [[Interface:Classical propositional calculus|propositional logic]] and [[Interface:First-order logic with quantifiability|first-order logic]].

As usual, capital letters starting from <code>A</code> are set expressions (that is, objects or "classes") and lowercase letters starting with <code>x</code> are set variables.
<jh>
var (object A B C D A0 A1 B0 B1)
var (variable x y z w)
</jh>

== Ordered pair ==
The ordered pair <code>〈A, B〉</code> can be defined in several ways as long as the definition implies the key ordered pair theorem <code>〈A0, B0〉=〈A1, B1〉↔ A0 = A1 ∧ B0 = B1</code>. The most widely adopted definition is <code>〈A, B〉≝ { {A}, {A, B} }</code>, which is the one we use. Because the notation <code>〈A, B〉</code> is not available in JHilbert, we call it <code>(orderedPair A B)</code>.
<jh>
def ((orderedPair A B) (unorderedPair (singleton A) (unorderedPair A B)))

== To be added ==
Either here or in other set theory files: induction, recursion, ordinal successors. some kinds of unions, intersection, set difference, and so on.
