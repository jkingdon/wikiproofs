We first import [[Interface:Classical propositional calculus|propositional logic]] and [[Interface:First-order logic with quantifiability|first-order logic]].
<jh>
import (CLASSICAL Interface:Classical_propositional_calculus () ())
import (FIRSTORDER Interface:First-order_logic_with_quantifiability (CLASSICAL) ())
</jh>

We also import [[Interface:Relations 1]], which covers set theory up until this point. 
<jh>
import (START Interface:Relations_1 (CLASSICAL FIRSTORDER) ())
</jh>

As usual, capital letters starting from <code>A</code> are set expressions (that is, terms or "classes") and lowercase letters starting with <code>x</code> are set variables.
<jh>
var (object A B C D A0 A1 B0 B1 α β Z)
var (variable a b x y z w a′ b′ x′ y′ z′)
var (formula φ ψ antecedent)
</jh>

== To be added ==
Either here or in other set theory files: induction, recursion, ordinal successors. some kinds of unions, intersection, set difference, and so on.

== Export ==
We are ready to export to [[Interface:Set theory]].
<jh>
export (RESULT Interface:Set_theory (CLASSICAL FIRSTORDER) ())
</jh>
