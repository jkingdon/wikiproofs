The '''[[w:real numbers|real numbers]]''' are defined here by axioms which define addition, multiplication, and the [[w:completeness of the real numbers|completeness]] property. Here we add some elementary consequences of the axioms such as subtraction.

We import the interfaces we build on, which are logic, set theory, and the real number axioms.

== Subtraction ==
We define <code>b − a</code> to be the unique number <code>x</code> for which <code>a + x = b</code>. Our notation for this is <code>⋃ { x ∈ ℝ | a + x = b }</code>, which works because the union of a singleton is the singleton's element.
