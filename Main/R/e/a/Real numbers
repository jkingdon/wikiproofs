The '''[[w:real numbers|real numbers]]''' are defined here by axioms which define addition, multiplication, and the [[w:completeness of the real numbers|completeness]] property. Here we add some elementary consequences of the axioms such as subtraction.

We import the interfaces we build on, which are logic, set theory, and the real number axioms.
