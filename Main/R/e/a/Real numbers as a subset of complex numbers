The [[w:real number|real numbers]] can be seen as those [[w:complex number|complex numbers]] which have imaginary part zero. In our context, that means we can prove [[Interface:Real numbers]] from complex numbers. Starting from [[Interface:Complex numbers]], this is fairly simple because it already has many theorems for the reals, so here we just need to restate a few variations, or in some cases prove that an operation applied to real numbers yields reals.

We import the interfaces we build on, which are logic, set theory, and the complex numbers.
