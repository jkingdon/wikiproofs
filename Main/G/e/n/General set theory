 | notes    = Here we start with the axioms of set theory and prove theorems for the usual concepts: empty set, singletons, unordered pairs, ordered pairs, relations, functions, some kinds of unions, intersection, set difference, and so on.  Although general set theory does not have any axioms which allow us to construct infinite sets, it does not forbid them either and all of the results here will be applicable for infinite sets as well, if supplemented by axioms which posit the existence of such sets. }}

We start by importing the theorems of [[Interface:Classical propositional calculus|propositional logic]] and [[Interface:First-order logic with quantifiability|predicate logic]], and the [[Interface:Axioms of general set theory]].  We also define some variables.

{{under construction}}
The [[w:empty set|empty set]], or null set, is the set with no elements. We start with the conventional form of the [[w:Axiom of empty set|axiom of empty set]], which is a theorem rather than an axiom for us (and for many other axiomizations of set theory).<ref>[http://us.metamath.org/mpeuni/axnul.html axnul], metamath's set.mm, accessed July 19, 2010</ref>

The only set theory axiom we use in the proof is the axiom of separation, which says that given the existence of any set (which is implicit in some the predicate logic steps), we can construct a subset of it which has no elements. Here is our application of separation, which we will use at the end of the proof (after a bunch of logical steps).

The proof starts with <code>¬ (y ∈ y ∧ ¬ y ∈ y)</code>

We now add <code>y ∈ z</code> to get <code>¬ (y ∈ z ∧ (y ∈ y ∧ ¬ y ∈ y))</code>

We note that <code>y ∈ x ↔ (y ∈ z ∧ (y ∈ y ∧ ¬ y ∈ y))</code> implies itself.

We detach half the biconditional to get <code>(y ∈ x ↔ (y ∈ z ∧ (y ∈ y ∧ ¬ y ∈ y))) → ¬ y ∈ x</code>

We're almost there. We just need to add the quantifiers and apply the instance of the axiom of separation that we started with.

When it exists, we'll be able to export to [[Interface:General set theory theorems]].
