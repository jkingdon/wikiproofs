We start with propositional logic and our axioms.

<jh>
import (PROPOSITIONAL Interface:Intuitionistic_propositional_logic () ())
import (AXIOMS Interface:Axioms_of_intuitionistic_first-order_logic (PROPOSITIONAL) ())
</jh>

As usual, φ and ψ are formulas, x, y, and z are variables, and s, t, and u are terms:

<jh>
var (formula φ ψ φx φy φs antecedent)
var (object s t u s0 s1 t0 t1)
var (variable x y z x0 x1 y0 y1)
</jh>

We largely follow the development from [[First-order logic in terms of substitution built on equality]] although some of the details are different and of course we don't prove quite all the theorems.

== A few rules based on axioms ==
Here are two rules which are convenience forms of an axiom, just as in [[First-order logic in terms of substitution built on equality]]
<jh>
thm (specializeToObject () ((H (∀ x φ))) (subst s x φ) (
        H
        x φ s SpecializationToObject
        applyModusPonens
))

thm (specializeToObjectInConsequent () ((H (antecedent → (∀ x φ)))) (antecedent → (subst s x φ)) (
        H
        x φ s SpecializationToObject
        applySyllogism
))
</jh>

== Generalization ==
