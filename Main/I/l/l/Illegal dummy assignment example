The easiest way to get some statements to work with is going to be to import one of our existing interfaces; here we pick [[Interface:Classical_propositional_calculus]].
<jh>
import (PROPOSITIONAL Interface:Classical_propositional_calculus () ())
</jh>

The only statement we care about from that file is:
 stmt (AntecedentIntroduction () () (p → (q → p)))

Here's a valid proof:

<jh>
var (formula r s)
thm (valid () () (r → (s → r)) (
        r s AntecedentIntroduction
))
</jh>

Here's one which produces a statement which has the right form, but the wrong variables. {{error expected|Attempt to prove result by illegal dummy assignment}}

<jh>
thm (invalid () () (r → (s → s)) (
        r s AntecedentIntroduction
))
</jh>
