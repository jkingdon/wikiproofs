You may also carry out your experiments in the <code>User interface</code> and <code>User module</code> namespaces.

I'll write this sort of in the style of [[Nicod's reduction of Principia Mathematica]], with a theory at the beginning and transport theorems at the end.

For convenience, I'll import the [[Interface:Nicod axioms|Nicod axioms]] rather than making another sandbox interface:
<jh>
import (NICOD Interface:Nicod_axioms () ())
</jh>

Transport theorems:

<jh>
kindbind (wff .wff)
# this isn't working: 
#def ((.¬ p) (¬ p))

# Uncomment this once it is ready:
#export (SANDBOX Interface:Sandbox () .)
</jh>
