Here we show that the real numbers form a field, in the sense that we can export to [[Interface:First-order field axioms]].

We import [[Interface:Classical propositional calculus]], [[Interface:First-order logic with quantifiability]],  [[Interface:Set theory]], and [[Interface:Complex number axioms]].

<jh>
import (CLASSICAL Interface:Classical_propositional_calculus () ())
import (QUANTIFY_OVER_SETS Interface:First-order_logic_with_quantifiability (CLASSICAL) set.)
import (SETS Interface:Set_theory (CLASSICAL QUANTIFY_OVER_SETS) ())
import (COMPLEX Interface:Complex_numbers (CLASSICAL QUANTIFY_OVER_SETS SETS) set.)
</jh>

We also import an interface, [[Interface:Restricting all quantifiers]], which provides the mapping between quantifiers which range over sets and quantifiers which range over real numbers. The reason for this to be a separate interface rather than just a set of definitions and theorems in this file is that when it comes time to export to [[Interface:First-order field axioms]], we'll need an interface to pass as a parameter.
<jh>
def ((universe) (set.ℝ))
export (UNIVERSE Interface:Universe (CLASSICAL QUANTIFY_OVER_SETS SETS) ())

import (QUANTIFY_OVER_POINTS Interface:Restricting_all_quantifiers
  (CLASSICAL QUANTIFY_OVER_SETS SETS UNIVERSE) ())
</jh>

The interface [[Interface:Restricting all quantifiers]] defines a kind for restricted terms called <code>object</code>, which corresponds to a real number.
<jh>
kindbind (object real)
</jh>

Now we define some variables.

<jh>
var (variable x y z w)
var (object X Y Z W)
var (set.variable a b c)
var (set.object A B C D)
var (formula φ)
</jh>

The following definition should perhaps go in [[Interface:Restricting all quantifiers]] although that perhaps is a question of whether that interface assumes the axiom of quantifiability.
<jh>
def ((subst Y x φ) (set.subst (asSet Y) (asSetVariable x) φ))
</jh>

== Addition ==
<jh>
def ((+ X Y) ((asSet X) set.+ (asSet Y)))
</jh>

== Export ==
<jh>
#export (FIELD Interface:First-order_field_axioms (CLASSICAL QUANTIFY_OVER_POINTS) ())
</jh>
