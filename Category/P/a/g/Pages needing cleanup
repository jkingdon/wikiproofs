This category and its subcategories contain pages which have a cleanup template on them. To add a page to a cleanup category, put a cleanup template on the page (you can see a list at [[:Category:Cleanup templates]]). If there does not seem to be a suitable cleanup template, use {{[[Template:Cleanup|cleanup]]}}. To clean pages up, browse to a page in one of the subcategories, fix the issues that led to the cleanup template being applied, and then remove the template.
