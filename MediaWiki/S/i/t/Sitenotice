Starting '''Wednesday, 4&nbsp;January 2012, 12:00 UTC''', a critical software upgrade will take place at Wikiproofs. Hopefully, it won't take longer than a few hours, during which site will remain available (though read-only) except for maybe a few hiccups. We apologise for the inconvenience.--[[User:GrafZahl|GrafZahl]]&nbsp;([[User talk:GrafZahl|talk]]) 21:46, 3 January 2012 (UTC)
