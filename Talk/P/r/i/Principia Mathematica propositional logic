== Need for .foo versus foo ==

I think I understand why [[Nicod's reduction of Principia Mathematica]] needs both .Taut and Taut (and likewise for all the others), based on the two different definitions of implication. On the other hand, in this module, to get it to export, I seem to face a similar problem but it is just about the names.  It seems solvable by just adding <code>thm (.True () () (‚ä§) (True))</code> and likewise for all the others, but before I go add that for every one, I thought I should ask whether there is an easier or better way.
