== Need for .foo versus foo ==

I think I understand why [[Nicod's reduction of Principia Mathematica]] needs both .Taut and Taut (and likewise for all the others), based on the two different definitions of implication. On the other hand, in this module, to get it to export, I seem to face a similar problem but it is just about the names.  It seems solvable by just adding <code>thm (.True () () (⊤) (True))</code> and likewise for all the others, but before I go add that for every one, I thought I should ask whether there is an easier or better way.

:The dot is just an arbitrary prefix. You can choose any character sequence which would make a valid identifier instead. Plus (and that's probably what you want here) you can take the empty string as prefix by replacing <code>.</code> with <code>()</code> in your export.--[[User:GrafZahl|GrafZahl]]&nbsp;([[User talk:GrafZahl|talk]]) 11:43, 10 January 2010 (UTC)

::Yeah, thanks.  I figured that out within an hour of posting the question, but by that time I was already in bed and figured it could wait for the morning. [[User:Kingdon|Kingdon]] 13:33, 10 January 2010 (UTC)

== Eliminating double negation ==

The proof of converse-of-*3.37 is supposed to just be the proof from page 122 of Whitehead and Russell, which reads in its entirety, "[*3.37 . *4.13]". Unless I'm missing something (which is of course possible), they are invoking 4.13 combined with the statement from page 120, "It should be observed that, if p ↔ q, q may be substituted for p without altering the truth-value of any function of p which involves no primitive ideas except those enumerated in #1. This can be proved in each separate case, but not generally, because we have no means of specifying (with our apparatus of primitive ideas) that a function is one which can be built up out of these ideas alone."  Is there a better way to remove the double negation (better than the hard-to-write and hard-to-read 10 line proof which I came up)? The answers aren't clear to me, but I thought I should ask before I go through the same exercise for *4.15. [[User:Kingdon|Kingdon]] 06:25, 26 January 2010 (UTC)
