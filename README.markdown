This repository is just an incomplete mirror of the mathematical proofs and related pages at http://www.wikiproofs.de/

I manually update it from time to time, but the wiki is the master. The reason I have a git repository is just to keep
track of what I do on my laptop when I don't have reliable internet access. The reason I pushed it to github is
to sync both of my laptops (although I made it public just in case it is useful to someone else). Having said all that,
git-backed wikis strike me as a win-win in terms of reconciling the wiki "easily edit it by a click in your browser"
versus wanting to download something and work on it locally.

The manual way that I update this git repository is a workaround for mediawiki XML format 0.3 not being supported by http://github.com/scy/levitation and
me not even knowing whether 0.3 is supported by http://github.com/sbober/levitation-perl . If levitation, or some
similar tool, can be made to work on wikiproofs, this repository could be generated from levitation which would
be a whole lot easier than what I have been doing.
