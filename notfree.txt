Plan:

1. Rename existing theorems, e.g. ForAllAddRemove to ForAllAddRemoveNotFree

2. Add variants with distinct variable constraints.

3. Add ThereExistsConjunctionMovementNotFree and ThereExistsConjunctionMovement.

4. Prove ThereExistsToFront using ThereExistsConjunctionMovement.

5. That should be enough for LessEqualTransitivity.
