== better error message for failed export? ==

I thought I would see whether I could make any progress on finishing [[Principia Mathematica propositional logic]]. A little experimentation seemed to show that if an export fails because the page is missing a <code>thm</code> for one of the <code>stmt</code> in the interface, the error message fails to tell the user which <code>stmt</code> was unproved. Would it be easy to add this to the error message? [[User:Kingdon|Kingdon]] 23:48, 3 January 2010 (UTC)

:What was the error message you were getting? You may also want to try the command line version of JHilbert [http://www.mathi.uni-heidelberg.de/~alex/jhilbert/downloads.html] with different debug level settings.--[[User:GrafZahl|GrafZahl]]&nbsp;([[User talk:GrafZahl|talk]]) 08:22, 6 January 2010 (UTC)

::The easiest way to reproduce this is to go to [[Nicod's reduction of Principia Mathematica]], remove the line "thm (.Add () () (q .→ (p .∨ q)) (" (and the next three lines which go with it), and click preview. The error is:
 export (PRINCIPIA Interface:Principia_Mathematica_propositional_logic () . Unable to export parameter 
 PRINCIPIA(Interface:Principia_Mathematica_propositional_logic)[]+.: Parameter mismatch: object not found
::I would have hoped for something like "export failed: statement Add is not proven". It might turn out that downloading JHilbert and the pages in question is indeed going to be the easiest way to work, but part of what excited me about wikiproofs was the possibility of skipping that step. [[User:Kingdon|Kingdon]] 02:40, 7 January 2010 (UTC)

:::Should be fixed now. The trouble with the current state of affairs is that JHilbert is the outgrowth of command line utilities and the logging/reporting facilities of JHilbert in command line mode vs. server mode are still quite conflated. I'm working on a rewrite but with all my RL stuff things are going very slowly atm.--[[User:GrafZahl|GrafZahl]]&nbsp;([[User talk:GrafZahl|talk]]) 06:41, 7 January 2010 (UTC)

::::Thanks, looks much better.  Don't get too stressed about it; there probably would have been workarounds to this problem. [[User:Kingdon|Kingdon]] 15:18, 7 January 2010 (UTC)

== doubled names ==

If I look at [[Interface:Nicod axioms]], the rendered page contains:
 def (¬¬ p) (p | p))
In case it helps, the HTML for the doubled ¬ is:
 <nowiki><span class="beginexp">¬</span><span class="def">¬</span></nowiki>

Clicking on "edit" shows only a single character:
 def ((¬ p) (p | p))

I believe this started happening within the last day or so.

One other thing (which might not be related, or even a bug at all). Uncommenting both commented out lines at [[Sandbox]] shows an error
 def (.¬.¬ p Variable not found Variable not found: (cause unknown)

:Seems like the last update introduced some sort of bug (a <code>beginexp</code> is an opening parenthesis, nothing else). Maybe I can look into it over the weekend.--[[User:GrafZahl|GrafZahl]]&nbsp;([[User talk:GrafZahl|talk]]) 10:45, 8 January 2010 (UTC)

::The name doubling bug is fixed now. The "variable not found" message is not a bug. You must define all variable names anew for each module: variable names are always local. This makes sense as variables usually have very simple (one or two letter) identifiers and you wouldn't want them to clash due to kind mismatches over several modules.--[[User:GrafZahl|GrafZahl]]&nbsp;([[User talk:GrafZahl|talk]]) 14:37, 9 January 2010 (UTC)

:::Ah, thanks for noticing that.  The only connection between the two is that the doubling bug affected the text of the error message (the existence of the message was, as you point out, unrelated). [[User:Kingdon|Kingdon]] 02:08, 10 January 2010 (UTC)

== Similar-looking characters ==

When copying formulas from other web sites, one is sometimes nailed by similar-looking characters. The two which have come up so far are:

* metamath uses ⋀ (U+22C0 N-ARY LOGICAL AND) for its ordinary conjunction character, we use ∧ (U+2227 LOGICAL AND).  It is easy to make the case that metamath is just wrong on this one, and at least in my font the two are moderately different from each other.

* We use ⋅ (U+22C5 DOT OPERATOR) for multiplication (at least, that's the one at the bottom of the edit screen). On wikipedia, at least on [[w:Peano arithmetic]], they use · (U+00B7 MIDDLE DOT). These look extremely similar, and I don't really see how we can expect contributors to try to keep them straight.

Is there a mediawiki feature to map all U+00B7 to U+22C5? I'm thinking of the feature of [http://eo.wikipedia.org eo.wikipedia.org] which maps "cx" to "ĉ" (U+0109 LATIN SMALL LETTER C WITH CIRCUMFLEX) although I'm not sure that particular behavior is exactly what we want (I haven't gotten desperate enough to actually read any mediawiki documentation, so I have no idea how many choices there are).

It turns out to be pretty handy to copy-paste short formulas from one website to another, and modulo some parentheses and such it tends to work fairly well (even with ↔, ∀, ∃, etc), except for the problem characters above. [[User:Kingdon|Kingdon]] 02:37, 23 February 2010 (UTC)

:Metamath also uses U+00B7 MIDDLE DOT (for example in [http://us.metamath.org/mpeuni/sqr2irr.html sqr2irr]).  Perhaps the solution to that one is just to switch. Dunno. [[User:Kingdon|Kingdon]] 02:48, 23 February 2010 (UTC)

::I've switched the dot in [[MediaWiki:Edittools]] for now. On my system, the characters ⋀ and ∧ look markedly different on the rendered webpage, but only moderately different in the editor window (which uses a fixed-width font). Raph and I already discussed this problem some months ago. The correct solution is probably to define equivalence classes of similar-looking characters within JHilbert. That won't happen too soon, though, as there are other, more pressing problems. Meanwhile, it seems sensible to install an equivalence mapping in MediaWiki if it's not too dear. Do you have any idea how the Esperanto Wikipedia people implement their "cx" mapping? Some extension, or some Javascript?--[[User:GrafZahl|GrafZahl]]&nbsp;([[User talk:GrafZahl|talk]]) 09:33, 23 February 2010 (UTC)

:::The Esperanto wikipedia doesn't rely on javascript; it works without it (and, obviously, doesn't map any characters until the page is submitted).  I don't think it is what we want, though, as the character gets mapped back to "cx" for editing.  I'm not sure I like the JHilbert solution, as it would lead to pages containing a mixture of different symbols and the reader would be expected to figure out which ones are equivalent (particular in a case like the conjunction, where the wrong symbol really does look wrong, at least to my eyes). None of this is particularly high priority, though (especially since the dot seems managed for now), so I wouldn't lose any sleep over it. [[User:Kingdon|Kingdon]] 13:58, 23 February 2010 (UTC)

::::Now this is odd. The cx and friends replacement is hard-coded in <code>./languages/classes/LanguageEo.php</code> of the MediaWiki source. So this is not an easy way to maintain character mappings. The original JHilbert plan was to create equivalence classes only for characters that can be expected to be rendered equally by common fonts (such as the two dots), i.e. roughly the same class of cases where you would apply it to host/domain names for security reasons. For merely similar looking characters, one could implement canonical mappings. This would effectively eliminate non-canonical characters from JHilbert text (but not all Wiki text). Not sure if that's what we really want, so, as you suggest, let's wait and see for now.--[[User:GrafZahl|GrafZahl]]&nbsp;([[User talk:GrafZahl|talk]]) 15:24, 23 February 2010 (UTC)

== Add ≠ to edit tools ==

I propose to add ≠ (U+2260 NOT EQUAL TO) to [[MediaWiki:Edittools]], just to the right of ∃. [[User:Kingdon|Kingdon]] 16:46, 3 March 2010 (UTC)

:Done.--[[User:GrafZahl|GrafZahl]]&nbsp;([[User talk:GrafZahl|talk]]) 17:59, 3 March 2010 (UTC)

::Thanks, looks good. [[User:Kingdon|Kingdon]] 19:38, 3 March 2010 (UTC)

== Kind verification and coercion ==

I'm concerned about something and want to make sure it gets attention.

In [[Interface:First-order_logic]], subst is introduced, then in [[First-order_logic]] defined:

<pre>
term (formula (subst object object formula))
def ((subst y x φ) (((x = y) → φ) ∧ (∃ x ((x = y) ∧ φ))))
</pre>

But in [[Basic_arithmetic]] it is being invoked quite a bit with terms of kind "nat", rather than "object".

Is kind verification not working? If not, I think there is serious risk of unsoundness.

Also, I realize I don't understand enough about the kind system in JHilbert to know whether terms of one kind can be implicitly coerced into another. In set.mm, then answer is "yes," due to this rule:

<pre>
  cv $a class x $.
</pre>

In old Ghilbert, all such syntactical productions need to have explicit s-expression counterparts. Thus, you saw an awful lot of (cv x) for variables that appear in class contexts. The idea was that such things would go away when presenting theorems in the typeset syntax, but it was still awkward and painful to deal with. Thus, getting rid of that was one of the explicit motivations to switch from distinct variables to free variables in the new Ghilbert (thus, the new distinction between var and tvar, for binding and term variables respectively).

So, does JHilbert do implicit coercion from one kind to another? If so, how is it controlled to make sure it's sound? If not, I'm pretty sure there's some serious wrongness going on in the first order logic area here. {{unsigned|17:53, 3 March 2010|Raph}}

:In JHilbert "coercion" (one form of <code>kindbind</code>) is mutual, meaning that in effect, there is only one kind with two or more names. (I'm pretty sure the old Ghilbert already had this functionality.) In particular, you should not bind <code>set</code> and <code>class</code> as then, all classes would be sets (which means you still need <code>term (class (cv set))</code> or a similar construct).

:You can use <code>kindbind</code> in two ways. The first one is to create a new name for an already existing kind. The second one, available in interfaces only, is to declare two already existing kinds imported via <code>param</code> to be equivalent. Of course, both can be dangerous in their way. The first one in a purely semantic manner: if you declare <code>nat</code> to be another name for <code>object</code> and your universe of discourse is not actually the natural numbers, you'll confuse the hell out of your users. The second one can break things badly if you bind things together that don't belong together, such as <code>formula</code> and <code>object</code>. That's why it's only available in interfaces.

:--[[User:GrafZahl|GrafZahl]]&nbsp;([[User talk:GrafZahl|talk]]) 18:56, 3 March 2010 (UTC)

::Okay, but I'm pretty sure what I'm talking about is completely separate from kindbind. You ''cannot'' alias the kinds for binding variables and terms (set and class in the set.mm universe). If you did, then ∃ (1) ((1) = (2)) would be not only a well-formed expression, but actually a theorem. So I'm pretty confused now what kinds of protection JHilbert has against this. [Fyi, new Ghilbert has very cut-down kindbind, which cannot be used to unify two existing kinds, but only to introduce a new name for an existing kind, which is useful when exporting from an "adapter". This seems obviously sound to me but I am worried it's too restrictive.]

::Also, nowhere in the interfaces or proof files referenced above did I find any actual invocation of kindbind. From what I can tell, the term was defined with one vector of kind args, and instantiated with another. [[User:Raph|Raph]] 19:24, 3 March 2010 (UTC)

:::I also answered this at [[Talk:First-order logic]] (a few days ago), but the kindbind is in [[Interface:Peano axioms]] (which is imported by [[Basic arithmetic]]). [[User:Kingdon|Kingdon]] 19:36, 3 March 2010 (UTC)

::::Ah, sorry to have missed the response there (I do try to follow Recent Changes but sometimes miss things). I'm 99% sure that <code>kindbind</code> is invalid, that your axiomatization of Peano is unsound, and that in particular I can prove the above nonsensical theorem. I'd be happy to be convinced otherwise, but my strong sense is that it needs to be fixed, and I'm not at all sure how to do it in the JHilbert world without adding explicit <code>(cv x)</code> terms. [[User:Raph|Raph]] 19:47, 3 March 2010 (UTC)

:::::I think I understand (somewhat) now. If I'm right, object versus nat is a red herring, and the real problem is the attempt to make object do the work of two things which need to be separated.  In peano.mm in the metamath distribution, these are "term" and "var" (and "tvar $a term v $." is the equivalent of cv, basically). In set.mm it is basically class versus set (although set.mm has enough other complications that it perhaps isn't the clearest example). In [http://levien.com/garden/ghnew/peano/], the new ghilbert features (var vs. tvar) handle this. I think I should probably try to fix this for now with explicit cv (unless var and tvar can be implemented pretty fast). It is quite painful for readability (all the n's and m's in <code>((n · (succ m)) = (n + (n · m))))</code> need to be <code>(cv n)</code> and <code>(cv m)</code>, right?).  But the only other choice I can think of is a big disclaimer at the top of [[First-order logic]] and friends saying "this is broken until JHilbert gets more features". [[User:Kingdon|Kingdon]] 21:03, 3 March 2010 (UTC)

::::::Oh yes, I see the misunderstanding now, too. The JHilbert command <code>kindbind</code> has ''nothing at all'' do to with bound and free variables. It's really only for establishing an equivalence relation among kinds. <code>nat</code> is just an alias for <code>object</code>. The built-in metalogic of JHilbert allows unlimited proper substitution of any single variable in an expression, so you need a different "object" kind for the quantifiers and in your definition of subst. Sorry, I should have paid more attention. And yes, you need explicit coercion terms. I know it's ugly. My plan to fix this ugliness is to add an additional layer above the s-expression representation. But this has lower priority than fixing the metalogic kernel. As of now, I still haven't read the new Ghilbert spec (sorry about that, too) and I'm therefore still undecided as to which of the various proposals to actually prove sound (hopefully) and implement. So you'll have to live with explicit coercion for a while longer.--[[User:GrafZahl|GrafZahl]]&nbsp;([[User talk:GrafZahl|talk]]) 22:22, 3 March 2010 (UTC)

:::::::It's OK.  If that's the only fundamental error I make on first-order logic, I'll be happy (given how much this treatment differs from textbook versions and how much I'm learning as I go). I hope to start fixing this one tomorrow (using an explicit conversion).

Okay, cool, it seems like we're all on the same page now. Note that the Ghilbert spec is not yet complete - I'm poking at it in moments of spare time. But here are some questions to ponder:

* If we know that the explicit coercions are ugly, and we choose implicit coercion from variable to term, why not also incorporate free variables into the metalanguage? This will eliminate the need for separate <code>foo</code> and <code>foov</code> variants of the same theory (as in set.mm), as well as the stack of hb* theorems to support the use of the former.

* If there is going to be a separate typesetting layer on top of the low-level representation, why not make the low-level as simple as possible and require the term name to come first, before the arguments? Clearly this layer will have to resolve precedence and other similar rules; it seems to me that doing prefix ↔ infix conversion naturally falls into the same category.

In other words, let's take a really close look at the divergences between Ghilbert and JHilbert. The ones that have a really good reason to exist are fine, and we'll write translation scripts so that work can flow between the two systems. But in other cases, I think it makes more sense to resolve by working out which design choice really is best. That's one of the reasons why I'm also writing a Rationale in parallel with the spec itself, to make the reasoning behind those design choices clearer. [[User:Raph|Raph]] 23:22, 3 March 2010 (UTC)

:I think I agree with what both of you are saying about a layer above the s-expressions except the word "typesetting".  I have been assuming this is something which happens on input, not on output. To be even more specific, when I click "edit" I would like to be editing something nice - in infix, with precedence if we get that, and probably with whatever else gets handled at this level. [[User:Kingdon|Kingdon]] 01:34, 4 March 2010 (UTC)

::Yes, I'm planning on translation for both input and output. I've already prototyped an input method that lets you type symbols by using Metamath keys - you press "A" and ".", and on the second key the "A" turns into "∀". I have not yet prototyped parsing. One thing that was holding me up was trying to figure out whether I needed to build a seriously general purpose parser (for which I would use some variant of [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earley_parser Earley]), or whether I could hand-hack something simpler which would deal with the grammar actually in use. I think I'll go with the latter for now, but sometimes it's actually easier to solve the more general problem. [[User:Raph|Raph]] 01:59, 4 March 2010 (UTC)

:::Yes, some convergence would be nice. But I see two different kinds of issues with [GJ]Hilbert. One kind which affects the metalogic, and one kind which affects the user interface, translation front/backends, etc. I would really like to see the metalogical kernel fixed before thinking about anything else. I've posted some of my ideas to this end on [[Wikiproofs:JHilbert development]].

:::Raph, yesterday I tried to read your Ghilbert documents. There is still a lot of stuff I don't quite get (or maybe I overlooked some documents). So instead of separating kinds, you separate binding variables from term variables. Are term variables allowed to appear as definition dummies in a definiens? How do you specify that a binding variable is not free? I see that there is some extra parameter to the <code>term</code> command, can you give an example?

:::I understand Carl's proposal a little better and think it should be checked for (un)soundness asap. I'm aware of Raph's concern regarding Carl's separation of <code>def</code> and <code>defthm</code>, and the possibility of using the same definition twice. Maybe we can whittle a counterexample out of that, or see why it is sound nevertheless.

:::About typesetting, input, output, and parsing. Right now I believe that an Earley parser (or possibly a modification which allows ε-rules) is the best way to go. The user can provide a dynamic grammar quite naturally, by simple alteration of the <code>term</code> command. Earley happily eats all context-free dynamic grammars and provides all parsing ambiguities explicitly. This makes it easy for the user to define nice-looking expressions and provide disambiguators (precedence and associativity). It does have its drawbacks, though. It's not as fast as other parsers, and it's somewhat vague in detecting the reason for a parse error. But typically, single expressions will not be too long.

:::--[[User:GrafZahl|GrafZahl]]&nbsp;([[User talk:GrafZahl|talk]]) 18:42, 5 March 2010 (UTC)

::::Sorry, the documents are not complete and are still moving slowly. But hopefully I can answer your questions. No, term variables are not allowed as def dummies. Thus, a definition of true as φ↔φ is not valid. The best way to define true is probably ∀x x=x.

::::The extra parameter to term expresses that some binding variables may not be free. A canonical example is <code>term (wff ([/] A x ph) (x A))</code>. This specifies that if <code>x</code> occurs free in <code>A</code>, it also appears free in the whole term. Any binding variable mentioned in a term that does ''not'' have this additional clause is considered not free in the term. And the list of term arguments is explicit - it is only free occurrences of <code>x</code> in <code>A</code> that pass through; since ph is not mentioned, x is not free in <code>([/] A x ph)</code> if <code>x</code> is free in <code>ph</code> but not <code>A</code>.

::::We're probably very similar in our wishes for parsing and typesetting. That said, I'm ''much'' happier with divergence in that layer as long as there is convergence on the underlying layer, whether it's exactly the same thing (my preference) or pretty easy to write converters.

::::Here are just a few random thoughts about what I want for parsing. First, I want the parser to resolve ambiguity in kinds and possibly types (types being an additional explicit argument to quantifiers, and are used in axiomatizations of HOL). My peano axiomatization will have a naive set kind as well as a nat kind (this is mostly for syntactic convenience as it will not allow quantification over sets or, for that matter, any additional proving strength). Thus, there need to be two equality operators (I plan on using = for equality between two nats and =_ for equality between two sets). In the syntax, though, you just say n=m or S=T, and it resolves to the right one. This means that the disambiguation rules need to take into account validity.

::::Second, I want the parser to handle things often special-cased at the lexical level. Take the representation of decimal numbers, for example. The integer 123 can be represented as the S-expression <code>(|d (1) (|d (2) (3)))</code>. It would be awesome for the parser to be able to handle that. Strings and, for that matter, JSON-style structures can probably all fit in there.

::::Hope this helps, and I'm happy to keep discussing, even as my spec-writing goes slowly. -- [[User:Raph|Raph]] 20:13, 5 March 2010 (UTC)

:::::OK, let's see if I get freeness straight. Let x be a binding variable and let E be an expression. If E is x, then x is free in E. If E is <code>(foo E1 E2 &hellip; En)</code>, then ''all'' occurrences of x in E are free if there is a <math>k\in\{1,2,\ldots,n\}</math> such that x occurs free in Ek ''and'' the declaration of the term foo, say <code>term (bar (foo A1 A2 &hellip; An) &hellip)</code> has <code>(Ak x)</code> as additional clause. In any other case, ''no'' occurrence of x is free in E. Is that correct? Does x have to be in the parameter list for foo? I guess not, so you can say <code>term (wff (/\ ph ps) (x ph) (x ps))</code>. But what if I have a theory which has only wff variables (propositional calculus) which I want to use later to build set theory on top of it? Can I introduce freeness later?

:::::About parsing. The nice thing about the kind/var/term commands is that with only slight alterations you can use them to define complex context-free grammars. For example, you might say something like
<pre>
kind (wff)
kind (nat)
kind (set)
var (nat $n$ $m$)
var (set $S$ $T$)
term (nateq wff (nat $=$ nat))
term (seteq wff (set $=$ set))
</pre>
:::::(I abused the $ sign as delimiter for terminals here, so $ would have to be disallowed in expressions and identifiers). From that, the following grammar would be made:
<pre>
start:
    expression

expression:
    wff
    nat
    set

wff:
    nat = nat
    set = set

nat:
    n
    m

set:
    S
    T
</pre>
:::::That's an unambiguous grammar with terminals n, m, S, T and =. The syntax tree created by the parser corresponds to an S-expression (for example, <code>n=m</code> would become <code>(nateq n m)</code>). More complex grammars may no longer be unambiguous, but with this scheme, validity is never a problem as each grammar rule (except the start←expression rule) corresponds to precisely one command. For more complex terminals, you'd also need another parser before the Earley stage to break up the input string into terminals. A very simple regular grammar would be sufficient here (codable by hand). Disambiguation would be enforced by disallowing whitespace in terminals and forcing the user to insert whitespace where a terminal ambuguity would appear.

== object and variable now split ==

I've now split <code>object</code> in two everywhere.  I'd especially appreciate review of [[Interface:Axioms of first-order logic]] and [[Interface:Peano axioms]], because axioms don't have to be proved, and thus don't have that check on errors.  I took the approach of using <code>object</code> everywhere there wasn't a quantifier or substitution involved.  Some axiomizations use <code>variable</code> some of those places, and then the <code>object</code> versions could be proved from those by substitution. Oh, and the naming. I picked <code>variable</code> for the thing which quantification or substitution applies to, <code>object</code> for the thing which goes in an expression (such as on either side of equals), and <code>value</code> for the explicit conversion between the two. While I'm kind of pleased with this set, other names for variable could be quantifiable, substitutable, placeholder, etc, and other names for value could be toObject, $ (by analogy with programming languages like shell or make in which $ means a variable), etc. [[User:Kingdon|Kingdon]] 17:30, 4 March 2010 (UTC)

:I did a quick review. The object/variable split seems entirely fine to me, and I also agree with the naming choice - among other things, it's consistent with Ghilbert, which uses "var" for your variable and "num" for your "nat" (I'm perfectly willing to also use "nat" and am not sure why I chose "num" instead). That said, your definition of "subst" is still slightly faulty. In particular, <code>(subst (succ (value n)) n φ)</code> is always false. I'm not sure this actually causes unsoundness, though. My intuition is telling me that the induction rule is valid when k and n are distinct, and in the special case where they're not distinct, there's no way to satisfy the antecedent, so it's safe. My intuition is also telling me that the faulty definition is going to make it impossible to prove some of the other theorems about substitution, such as composition. In particular, [http://us.metamath.org/mpegif/sbccog.html sbccog] should prove [S x/y][y/x]φ ↔ [S x/x]φ, and that's not true under your definition. This might not be especially urgent to fix, though, as I think the changes should be relatively local to first order logic - the theorems you do export and rely on should all still be valid under the new definition. [[User:Raph|Raph]] 19:17, 4 March 2010 (UTC)

::Thanks. As for subst, it does look fishy although I'm not sure either what the effects are. Probably just lack of power, rather than unsoundness, since unsoundness could only happen if we hit one of the loopholes in definition safety (I don't think so, as I see no dummy variables), or if the Induction axiom turns out to specify something other than what it thinks it does (slightly more likely). Perhaps the simplest solution is the definition you posted to [[Talk:First-order logic]] a while ago. The only thing we're using subst for right now is introduceSubst and makeSubstExplicit, and I don't currently (anymore) have any plans to do anything more ambitious with it. [[User:Kingdon|Kingdon]] 22:37, 4 March 2010 (UTC)

:Hi, the Existence axiom <code>stmt (Existence () () (¬ (∀ x (¬ ((value x) = s)))) )</code> seems to say there is a variable equal to every object, or in metamath language, that there is a set equal to every class.  But that is false, see for instance the theorem [http://us.metamath.org/mpegif/vnex.html vnex].--[[User:DanKrejsa|DanKrejsa]] 02:53, 26 April 2010 (UTC)

:::What breaks, for instance, is <code>EqualityReflexivity</code> in [[First-order logic]]. IMO <code>EqualityReflexivity</code> does not belong there, at least not without saying more about the objects.

I'll drop [[User:Kingdon|Kingdon]] a note.--[[User:GrafZahl|GrafZahl]]&nbsp;([[User talk:GrafZahl|talk]]) 17:37, 26 April 2010 (UTC)

::::Hmm.  What would "saying more about the objects" entail? The version of <code>EqualityReflexivity</code> with terms seems to be in [http://code.google.com/p/ghilbert/source/browse/trunk/peano/peano_thms.gh peano_thms.gh] and peano.mm in the metamath distribution, for example. And certainly by the time we get to [[Basic arithmetic]] we need symmetry and transitivity with terms (we use them all over the place), which at least at the moment are proved from reflexivity. If I understand [http://us.metamath.org/mpeuni/vtocle.html vtocle], it can be used to derive the term version from the variable version. Now, the proof of that in metamath relies on [http://us.metamath.org/mpeuni/elex.html] which seems to be related to the existence axiom we are debating. I see that [[User:Raph|Raph]]'s peano_thms.gh seems to have the version of the existence axiom which DanKrejsa is objecting to. If we are OK with having reflexivity, symmetry, and transitivity for terms, I'd say just adopt them as axioms.  Many of the treatments I run into seem to do that, and it seems more straightforward than messing around with existence axioms. But if there is some additional condition needed to make them work for terms, then of course we need to know about that. [[User:Kingdon|Kingdon]] 13:55, 27 April 2010 (UTC)

:::::In email, GrafZahl contrasts metamath's [http://us.metamath.org/mpeuni/eqid.html eqid] which is for objects (classes, in that context) and is proved in terms of set theory, with [http://us.metamath.org/mpeuni/equid.html equid] which is proved in terms of logic and is only for variables. [[User:Kingdon|Kingdon]] 14:31, 27 April 2010 (UTC)

:::::I have now made reflexivity, symmetry and transitivity axioms, at least for now. If this causes problems, speak up.  The next thing to blow up is ImplicitSubstitutionForAll (similar to equsal in metamath's set.mm). [[User:Kingdon|Kingdon]] 18:49, 3 May 2010 (UTC)

::::::OK, I think I've figured it out.The way that quantification, sets, and classes work in set.mm is just different from the way it works in Raph's peano_thms.gh (as shown by the extra hypothesis in vtocl; more discussion at [[Interface:Axiom of quantifiability]]). Raph's way is probably better for Peano arithmetic and ZF set theory, although some other set theories might find it too constraining.  I've separated them into different pages, although at least for the present I plan to build on top of [[Interface:First-order logic with quantifiability]] rather than [[Interface:First-order logic]]. Feedback would be most welcome (in particular, I just made up the name "axiom of quantifiability" and don't really know whether there is something similar in the literature).

== Abstract versus Concrete Syntax ==

Hi Grafzahl and friends...

I finally found your note at http://wiki.planetmath.org/AsteroidMeta/ocat
Thanks for the heads up! I have busied myself during the last 14 months
with earning my keep, and frankly, a bit of a rest up from my mmj2 exertions.
Going forward I am undecided about where to focus my programming energies,
but there are aspects of Metamath-related work that interest me. I think
some of these may be relevant to your J/Ghilbert work, though I do not
presume to know anything more than I have already coded and tested in mmj2 :-)

One primary topic concerns the grammars -- i.e. syntax and presentation,
on input, output and internal. By "abstract" I mean the "normal" form
used internally after unambiguous parsing into tree form. "Concrete"
refers to external forms, which for example, may include redundant parentheses.
An example of concrete is 'a + b + c' and 'a + (b + c)' being equivalent 
to '(( a + b) + c)' (which is the abstract form) -- noting that '(a + (b + c))'
may be equal to '((a + b) + c) but that is something that must be proved
or given as a "law" or axiom. 

What we see in Metamath is that the abstract (internal) grammar/syntax is
identical to the concrete grammar/syntax. Metamath cannot tolerate 
redundant parentheses, and even if it could somehow ignore them in
specific cases there is no defined mechanism for translating between
abstract and concrete grammatical forms; a 'concrete' parse tree would
require a different proof than an equivalent 'abstract' parse tree, absent
a grammatical translator.

So, for ease of use we would like to see abstract and concrete grammars
available. Concrete syntax(es) statements would be parse and then
translated to abstract form for processing by the proof engine(s), and
then a reverse translation(s) would be performed for presentation output.

In addition, it might be very useful to develop a grammar generator
which would accept as input the typical sort of operator hierarchy
table and output context free grammars -- both abstract and concrete.

Finally, symbol translation tables could be developed to map between
different languages. 

p.s. you can email me in the future at k900f73 via yahoo.

:Good to see you here!

:I have to say, I'm a little confused by the distinction between abstract and concrete grammar. To me, the meaningful distinction is between the low-level grammar, which is (hopefully) pretty easy to parse and unambiguous, and the presentation layer that may sit above it, which is designed to be much closer to traditional mathematics. In some cases, the low-level grammar makes some concessions towards being more readable (i.e. both JHilbert and Metamath use infix), but in other cases not. Perhaps your distinction is more relevant in HOL, where there is both an accessible internal representation (using mk_abs to construct a lambda abstraction, for example) and a more palatable printed syntax used in virtually all communication with the user, still ASCII-based though.

:Further, in presentation you can do quite a bit more than just grammar. For one, you can use 2-d layout, like <math>\Sigma_{i=1}^\infty</math> or <math>e^{i\pi}</math>. It's possible to imagine a number of different input methods that would generate these types of results,  You can also tweak the spacing to make operator precedence more visually distinct (as I have done for the math typesetting in my interactive app, as well as the experiments generating PDF).

:I think the big confusion for me is: what do you expect to be stored in files? You can't store the full 2D graphical representation, so perhaps there's an intermediate grammar, something with Unicode and maybe markup <code>"e&lt;sup>iπ&lt;/sup>"</code>, for example. Or another possibility (pretty much what I'm doing so far) is to store everything in the low-level representation, and do the presentation on-the-fly. 

:Anyway, these are just some random thoughts. Nice to have you as part of the conversation, and hope to see you around more. [[User:Raph|Raph]] 00:58, 28 March 2010 (UTC)

:: Hi. I should have said "syntax" instead of "grammar", perhaps. 

:: This link has a discussion of abstract vs. concrete: http://nat.truemesh.com/archives/000531.html

:: The important quality for syntaxes is that the parse tree is unambiguous to the intended audience, whether a human or a program. Internally the abstract syntax is boiled down to, say, for '->', just the name/code of implication and the names/codes of the two operands, in a specific order. Externally there may be multiple input and output syntaxes, just so long as their meaning is unambiguous. Redundant parentheses may be present, or as you mention, the output syntax may be MathML, Tex, or whatever. There is a necessary transformation from/to abstract and concrete, and there is a necessary rendering layer for concrete syntax representations, as well as an input parser for each time language/data must be input, validated and converted into syntax trees in memory. 

:: What is stored in the file/database is up for discussion. I would probably want to be able to store the specifications for abstract and concrete syntaxes separately from the math content. Like "normal form" in database design. That facilitates gathering math content from different sources and sharing without having to modify program code.

:: This all sounds laborious and cruel, but going back and making changes later is worse.

[[User:Mellocat|Mellocat]] 14:19, 28 March 2010 (UTC)Mellocat

:::Ah, I think I understand better. Unless I'm still not getting it, the concrete syntax is what's in the file, and the abstract syntax is the data structure used in the implementation. In Ghilbert, I've been extremely careful to separate the interchange format from the implementation; the latter is basically free to do whatever it likes as long as it gets the proof validity predicate right. In particular, there's no programmatic API for accessing terms. This approach is in stark contrast with [http://sourceforge.net/projects/hol/files/hol/kananaskis-5-description.pdf/download HOL] (see p. 16 for a 12-line expression representing the abstract syntax of the expression <code>``\x. x+1``</code>). In any case, I'd like to continue this discussion further in [[Wikiproofs:Syntax_Discussions]], and have no problems with anyone refactoring the syntax discussion thread on this page over there. -- [[User:Raph|Raph]] 22:38, 28 March 2010 (UTC)

:::: A good example of the main "problem" (not that Metamath isn't perfect :-) I am first discussing is seen in the ramifications of defining the ternary "and" syntax axiom w3a (vs. binary "and" syntax axiom "wa".) And, because Metamath requires the concrete to be identical to the abstract syntax, extra parentheses introduced by the user for readability are prohibited. Also (then I would switch to your new page), compare the Metamath "operator" syntax to say, Python's (e.g. SageMath) -- I don't expect an individual to master multiple syntaxes, but different syntaxes might/ought be available, depending on the user's preference. Finally...the are 4 unary boolean operators, 16 binary boolean operators, and yada-yada ternary boolean operators -- their "names" are essentially arbitrary, but their identities are established across the world of math/computer science via their truth tables, so translations between different systems/languages should be programmatic (i.e. I shouldn't care that Norm refers to "wi" while you refer to "->" while Grafzahl refers to Unicode somthing-or-other, just so long as I have a translation table and syntax converter code.)

:: P.S. As an interesting side note about what can feasibly be done, about six months ago I upgraded my computer system to a dual Pentium R S5300 2.60GHz 64 bit processor/OS with 6GB RAM, and what is surely a faster hard drive. I also downloaded the latest JDK, 1.6.18, 64 bit version and recompiled mmj2 (though recompilation was not necessary.) Initial startup including starting the JVM, verifying all Metamath proofs, parsing, and display of the mmj2 GUI screen took 5.554 seconds. With my old machine that process took about 16 seconds. And consider that my new machine, a desktop, cost only $400.

== pointer to more thoughts on definitions ==

I've posted a comment at [[Wikiproofs talk:JHilbert definition soundness]] regarding my (now somewhat better informed) thoughts on how we should redesign the definition mechanism. Followup discussion is probably better conducted there than here. [[User:Kingdon|Kingdon]] 15:49, 27 June 2010 (UTC)

== New at www.wikiproofs.de ==

Hiya I’m new here. I’m sorry if "/w/index.php?title=Wikiproofs:Tearoom"
is not the right place for this post. My name is Rob
I am from  BRazil

:Hi, welcome to the site.  Was there any kind of contribution you were particularly interested in? There's plenty to do, from writing proofs to software development to writing explanatory text. [[User:Kingdon|Kingdon]] 00:13, 19 August 2010 (UTC)

== Feedback on main page ==

Hello, a friend of mine took a look at wikiproofs and was kind enough to write up his first impressions. Here is what he said:

 The main thing I was looking for on my first visit was a list of
 available proofs, or at least some examples. Also a simple example
 ("hello world".) I see now that Help:Tutorial counts as "hello world"
 - maybe you need a more prominent link for that? Also, for some reason
 I skimmed right over the "featured article" linking to Principa
 Mathematica propositional logic.

I've taken a shot at reorganizing the home page so that these things are more prominent at [[User:Kingdon/Main page]] ([http://www.wikiproofs.org/w/index.php?title=User:Kingdon/Main_page&diff=2064&oldid=2063 diffs from current main page]). Mostly this draft just moves things around, but I did trim out some verbiage and I'd also propose deleting [[Wikiproofs:Subject index|Subject index]] (it is superceded by some new main page text and of course things like the categories).

Reactions? [[User:Kingdon|Kingdon]] 02:39, 25 February 2011 (UTC)

:Sorry for taking so long to answer. I've been struggling with a bad cold since Tuesday. Thank you for your efforts with the main page. I like the new design of the blue box, and also that the featured article stands out better. I'm also OK with deleting the subject index page for now, though at some time, we might need something better than the MSC category. We should do something about the redlinks in the pink box. Maybe just remove them for now. When I'm well again, I'd like to restart the definition discussion we had with Carl and Raph about a year ago. It seems to have stopped just before interesting examples for the two proposed safe definition schemes were posted. Once I can implement something in my github repo which satisfies Carl and Raph, we will have come one step (of many) closer to a JHilbert specification. Anyway, just go ahead boldly. If there are still little things to fix, I can do so later.--[[User:GrafZahl|GrafZahl]]&nbsp;([[User talk:GrafZahl|talk]]) 22:13, 27 February 2011 (UTC)

::Hope you are feeling better soon and no worries about the delay. I've gone ahead and implemented those changes, and also deleted the redlinks in the pink box. As for the subject index, I agree that we may need more navigation at some point, but it will be easy enough to recreate when someone gets to it (and it might take another form(s) like a [[w:Wikipedia:Navigation templates|navbox]], or even some fancy software which ties into the import/export and can do things like "this theorem/module relies on these axioms/interfaces" across modules). Likewise for the redlinks - easy enough to recreate if/when anyone gets to that point. As for the definitions, glad to see you have gotten to the point of being ready to tackle them. I assume you've at least glanced at the ghilbert implementation (which as far as I know is at [http://ghilbert.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/]). [[User:Kingdon|Kingdon]] 02:43, 28 February 2011 (UTC)

== How to create private sandbox? ==

I would like to learn writing proofs for JHilbert. I know about the official [[Sandbox]]. Can I create a private (not publicly viewable) sandbox just for myself that I can reuse? [[User:Slawekk|Slawekk]] 08:45, 11 April 2011 (UTC)

:There's definitely a place where you can experiment freely and not collide with other people's experiments. Just create a page like [[User module:Slawekk/Sandbox]] (doesn't have to be called Sandbox, you can give it any name you'd like). This is publicly visible in the sense that someone who knows the name can load it, but searches don't return it (unless the person searching explicitly asks to search the User module namespace), so perhaps that it private enough (depending on why you were asking for that). [[User:Kingdon|Kingdon]] 17:10, 11 April 2011 (UTC)

== Automated translation from metamath ==

The more I look at metamath's set.mm, the more stuff I realize is there. Although I also have some stylistic issues with set.mm, and of course the metamath engine has some issues which led to the work on ghilbert/jhilbert, it would also be nice to be able to build on metamath. So my questions are this: (1) is there a published tool to produce translations like [http://code.google.com/p/ghilbert/source/browse/trunk/peano/prop.ghi prop.ghi] in ghilbert?, and (2) do people have any objection (or opinions pro/con) to importing this stuff to wikiproofs? What I had in mind was creating interfaces for the sections in the [http://us.metamath.org/mpeuni/mmtheorems.html metamath theorem list], for example [[Interface:Propositional calculus (metamath)]], [[Interface:ZF Set Theory - add the Axiom of Power Sets (metamath)]] and so on. I did not have in mind trying to pull over proofs, just interfaces. [[User:Kingdon|Kingdon]] 16:49, 19 May 2011 (UTC)

:I don't know of such a tool specifically for JHilbert (I haven't written one). If there is one for Ghilbert, you can probably base your work on that; the differences are currently not that big. I don't have objections against creating interfaces matching the metamath theorem list (Norm has released <code>set.mm</code> under CC0, so it should go well with our own licence).--[[User:GrafZahl|GrafZahl]]&nbsp;([[User talk:GrafZahl|talk]]) 20:16, 23 May 2011 (UTC)

::Thanks; I'll see if Raph can point me to his tool (which I suppose will need some changes) and then I'll see how much of a time sink this ends up being. My top priority right now is getting [[Interface:Trigonometry]] ready for [http://tauday.com tau day] in about a month, so I'm going to make sure I have something up there (prepared manually) before I get too deeply into messing around with tools. [[User:Kingdon|Kingdon]] 10:52, 26 May 2011 (UTC)

== $wgCapitalLinks ==

Can we change the setting of $wgCapitalLinks now while the wiki is small and it is easy? Right now we have the default behavior, in which [[p-adic number]] (for example) gets turned into P-adic number (and then, on wikipedia they have hacks like the lowercase template or DISPLAYTITLE to try to partially recover, see [[w:p-adic number]]). We're better off with just setting $wgCapitalLinks to false like they do on wiktionary: see [http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual:LocalSettings.php]. [[User:Kingdon|Kingdon]] 10:58, 26 May 2011 (UTC)

:Hi, I've disabled capital links for the relevant namespaces.--[[User:GrafZahl|GrafZahl]]&nbsp;([[User talk:GrafZahl|talk]]) 22:18, 28 May 2011 (UTC)

::Hmm, didn't realize it would be per-namespace. Anyway, looks good. If I link to lowercase pi ([[π]]) it really links to lowercase pi, not uppercase pi as wikipedia would. [[User:Kingdon|Kingdon]] 23:36, 30 May 2011 (UTC)

== Math goes Pop on Tau day ==
We got a [http://www.mathgoespop.com/2011/06/second-annual-tau-day-interview-and-ideas.html mention] on the math blog Math Goes Pop. Personally, I'm enjoying the tau day buzz even if it is a tau day buzz more than a wikiproofs buzz (one step at a time!). My co-workers and I went out for pie at lunch and sat on round bar stools (choosing those over rectangular chairs). [[User:Kingdon|Kingdon]] 22:15, 28 June 2011 (UTC)

== Second axiomization of first-order logic ==

Hi, although I haven't been spending a lot of time on talk pages I have been doing wikiproofs stuff. Some of it is JHilbert work. But the last few months have mostly been spent on a second axiomization of first-order logic, which is now live (and complete) at [[First-order logic in terms of substitution built on equality]]). My immediate motive was to play around with intuitionistic first-order logic, but there are any number of reasons to have an axiomization which is more closely based on Margaris (and other conventional first-order logic axiomizations). It was a bit of a surprise to me how concepts like "is not free in" or substitution have a relatively natural mapping to recursive definitions, which can be expressed in JHilbert. Right now, especially in the case of substitution, this axiomization doesn't really take things all the way, but instead ties in substitution into equality somewhat the way metamath does (and I probably adopted more substitution statements as axioms than I needed to). But as far as I can tell, one could come up with a theory of first-order logic without equality using the existing JHilbert verifier (the builder axioms, scattered throughout every axiom set which builds on first-order logic, would need modification, though, which was my main reason for adopting the halfway approach). It then might be possible to add some equality axioms to that theory to get [[Interface:First-order logic with quantifiability]].

Anyway, I thought I should highlight this development and see if there are any reactions. I suppose I should also ask people like Norm Megill or Raph Levien what they think. [[User:Kingdon|Kingdon]] 06:54, 16 February 2012 (UTC)

:Hi, just to let you know: I'm still watching the changes to the wiki, and, once again, thank you for your contributions. As for your question, I have to admit that, without actually diving into the matter, I'm out of my depth here. I hope someone of the others can help you.--[[User:GrafZahl|GrafZahl]]&nbsp;([[User talk:GrafZahl|talk]]) 20:27, 23 February 2012 (UTC)

::Thanks for the response. I found that this is (at least roughly) one of the unsolved problems on the metamath site: [http://us.metamath.org/award2003.html#17 17] so I'm hoping I can interest Mr. Megill once I put a few finishing touches on it. [[User:Kingdon|Kingdon]] 05:32, 27 February 2012 (UTC)
