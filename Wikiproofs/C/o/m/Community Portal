== Content improvement and maintenance ==

=== Mathematical content ===

We currently have some propositional logic, such as [[Nicod's reduction of Principia Mathematica]]. A generic "user-friendly" propositional logic module is still missing. The obvious next step would be first-order logic.

=== Non-mathematical content ===

Zip. Nada. Zilch. Someone better get started on it. ''But remember:'' Wikiproofs has its focus on proofs. It is not an [[w:ontology|ontology]], though JHilbert would technically be capable of maintaining one.

== Wikiproofs structure ==

Policies guidelines need to be crafted, large-scale projects organised, etc. ''This'' page could also do with an improvement.

== JHilbert verifier ==

A lot of stuff is still missing:
* Help pages (http://www.mathi.uni-heidelberg.de/~alex/jhilbert/commands.html might be a starting place).
* A formal specification of JHilbert. Not everything has been implemented yet in the current experimental version, such as functor selection also by [[w:type signature|type signature]] instead of name only, precedence and functor concatenation.
* Once a formal specification has been written, a programming interface reflecting the specification can be developed, test suites for it can be written, and finally the interface can be implemented.
* Better tutorials. [[Help:Tutorial]] is only a start.
