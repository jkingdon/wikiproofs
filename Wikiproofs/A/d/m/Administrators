Administrators are users with extended rights, among them:
* Capability to edit protected pages, most notably [[Mediawiki:Edittools]], [[Mediawiki:Common.css]] and the [[Main Page]].
* Blocking spammers/vandals. However, Wikiproofs sees very little spam/vandalism (as of March 2010).

See [[Special:ListAdmins]] for a list of administrators.

Since Wikiproofs is currently a private scientific project, administrator access is granted and revoked at the sole discretion of the site operator.
