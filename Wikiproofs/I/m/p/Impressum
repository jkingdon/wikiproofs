=== External links ===

This site contains external links, that is, [[w:hyperlink|hyperlink]]s to sites outside the <code>wikiproofs.de</code>  and <code>wikiproofs.org</code> domains. The scope and inherently scientific nature of this project should regularly exclude the possibility of an external link being illegal. However, due to the nature of the Wiki medium, the volatility of the World Wide Web and due to ever-changing laws, no warranty can be given that the exceptional link to an illegal site does not, at some given point in time, occur. Furthermore, existence of an external link on this site does not constitute an endorsement of the contents of the linked-to site.

If you detect an incriminating link, you can remove it yourself using the edit functionality of this wiki. This is the fastest method. Alternatively, you can contact the operator of this site (means of contact are on the top of this page) to have it removed.
