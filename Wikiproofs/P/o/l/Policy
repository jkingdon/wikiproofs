Wikiproofs is small enough that we don't have a lot of highly formalized policies, but wikipedia policies can give a general idea.  There are a few wikiproofs-specific policies; see:

* [[Wikiproofs:Scope]], concerning what does and does not belong here

* [[Wikiproofs:Copyrights]], concerning conditions under which content from Wikiproofs can be reused and modified
