Wikiproofs is small enough that we don't have a lot of highly formalized policies, but wikipedia policies can give a general idea.  There are a few wikiproofs-specific policies; see:

* [[Wikiproofs:Scope]], concerning what does and does not belong here

* [[Wikiproofs:Copyrights]], concerning conditions under which content from Wikiproofs can be reused and modified

== Redirects ==
Because [[Help:JHilbert|JHilbert]] does not follow redirects when processing proofs, redirects should not exist to interfaces or modules (until JHilbert is fixed). If you want to [[w:WP:MOVE|move a page]], first move it, then remove all references to the old name, then [[Wikiproofs:Administrator requests|ask an administrator]] to delete the redirect.
