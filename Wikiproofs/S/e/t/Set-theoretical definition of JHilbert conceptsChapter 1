== Names ==

The individual components of a JHilbert [[../Chapter 9|module]] are identified by ''names''. A name is a finite, non-empty sequence of ''symbols''. We shall denote our set of available symbols by <math>\Sigma</math> and our set of names by <math>\mathcal{N}</math>, so that <math>\mathcal{N}=\Sigma^+</math>.

For the purpose of this formal description, it is not necessary to specify the set of symbols <math>\Sigma</math> beyond the requirement that it must be non-empty. Further specification of <math>\Sigma</math> is the task of the [[Wikiproofs:JHilbert specification|JHilbert specification]]. The non-emptiness of <math>\Sigma</math> immediately implies

'''Proposition 1.1.''' The set of names <math>\mathcal{N}</math> is infinite.

In fact, for the most part of this formal description, we need only this fact. The explicit representation of names as finite sequences of symbols is only required for prefixing during [[../Chapter 12|import and export]].
