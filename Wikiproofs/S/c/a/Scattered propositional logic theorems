This is a list of propositional logic theorems which are proved outside [[:Category:Classical propositional logic]]. There are a number of ways of reacting to this situation:

# This theorem is only used one place (and perhaps is unlikely to be needed anywhere else), but it does make this particular proof more clear, so don't worry about it.
# This theorem is unnecessary; it would be simpler to just avoid it (for example, metamath's set.mm has a theorem to apply modus ponens twice, but at least so far in wikiproofs our decision has been that <code>applyModusPonens applyModusPonens</code> expresses this idea just as clearly).
# This theorem made it easier to translate a proof from another source, but ultimately it will be clearer to rearrange the proof using our usual idioms.
# This is really a fundamental theorem which belongs alongside the other core theorems of propositional logic in [[Interface:Principia Mathematica propositional logic theorems]]. Whether the theorem is in Principia is perhaps the largest criterion for whether it is fundamental. Others are whether it expresses a relationship between the various connectives or a statement which is not easily proved from other theorems.
# This is a convenience theorem which probably should be in [[Interface:Classical propositional calculus]] but is an easy consequence of the fundamental theorems and is therefore more naturally proved in [[Convenience theorems of propositional logic]].
