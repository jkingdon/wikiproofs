 | notes = This page collects theorems which strictly belong to propositional logic but are missing from [[:Category:Classical propositional logic]], most notably [[Interface:Classical propositional calculus]].
}}
This is a list of propositional logic theorems which are proved outside [[:Category:Classical propositional logic]]. There are a number of ways of reacting to this situation:

# This theorem is only used one place (and perhaps is unlikely to be needed anywhere else), but it does make this particular proof more clear, so don't worry about it.
# This theorem is unnecessary; it would be simpler to just avoid it (for example, metamath's set.mm has a theorem to apply modus ponens twice, but at least so far in wikiproofs our decision has been that <code>applyModusPonens applyModusPonens</code> expresses this idea just as clearly).
# This theorem made it easier to translate a proof from another source, but ultimately it will be clearer to rearrange the proof using our usual idioms.
# This is really a fundamental theorem which belongs alongside the other core theorems of propositional logic in [[Interface:Principia Mathematica propositional logic theorems]]. Whether the theorem is in Principia is perhaps the largest criterion for whether it is fundamental. Others are whether it expresses a relationship between the various connectives or a statement which is not easily proved from other theorems.
# This is a convenience theorem which probably should be in [[Interface:Classical propositional calculus]] but is an easy consequence of the fundamental theorems and is therefore more naturally proved in [[Convenience theorems of propositional logic]].

==The list==

From [[First-order logic]]:

* applyComm and applyNestedModusPonens (the former might obviate the need for the latter)
* also along those lines: mpan2
* rotate3Antecedents: like applyComm but when we need to move the first antecedent two steps in, not just one
* Comm (perhaps a wise policy not to have propositional logic rules which don't have corresponding theorems)
* principia*2.21
* joinConsequents
* anbi1d
* ImplicationDistributionOverBiconditional, distributeImplicationOverBiconditional (probably really is a missing theorem; at least it is in Principia and is not easy to derive from what we have already)
* ConjunctionImplication (*4.63), ImplicationConjunction (not a lot of work to get these from DeMorgan and DisjunctionImplication, but seems like the kind of relationship between connectives that GrafZahl was arguing for. Also, metamath proofs tend to use these)

From [[Basic arithmetic]]:
* BiconditionalBuilderRR, ImplicationBuilderRR: these are biconditionalized analogues to DisjunctionSummationRR, ConjunctionMultiplicationRR, etc. Not only do we use them here, I suspect a search for BiconditionalReflexivity would turn up more places where they could be helpful.
