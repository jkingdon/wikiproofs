 | notes = This page collects theorems which strictly belong to propositional logic but are missing from [[:Category:Classical propositional logic]], most notably [[Interface:Classical propositional calculus]].
}}
This is a list of propositional logic theorems which are proved outside [[:Category:Classical propositional logic]]. There are a number of ways of reacting to this situation:

# This theorem is only used one place (and perhaps is unlikely to be needed anywhere else), but it does make this particular proof more clear, so don't worry about it.
# This theorem is unnecessary; it would be simpler to just avoid it (for example, metamath's set.mm has a theorem to apply modus ponens twice, but at least so far in wikiproofs our decision has been that <code>applyModusPonens applyModusPonens</code> expresses this idea just as clearly).
# This theorem made it easier to translate a proof from another source, but ultimately it will be clearer to rearrange the proof using our usual idioms.
# This is really a fundamental theorem which belongs alongside the other core theorems of propositional logic in [[Interface:Principia Mathematica propositional logic theorems]]. Whether the theorem is in Principia is perhaps the largest criterion for whether it is fundamental. Others are whether it expresses a relationship between the various connectives or a statement which is not easily proved from other theorems.
# This is a convenience theorem which probably should be in [[Interface:Classical propositional calculus]] but is an easy consequence of the fundamental theorems and is therefore more naturally proved in [[Convenience theorems of propositional logic]].

==The list==

From [[First-order logic]]:

* Comm (perhaps a wise policy not to have propositional logic rules which don't have corresponding theorems)
* principia*2.21
* joinConsequents
* ImplicationDistributionOverBiconditional, distributeImplicationOverBiconditional (probably really is a missing theorem; at least it is in Principia and is not easy to derive from what we have already)
