== Geometry ==
See [[w:Category:Axiomatics of Euclidean geometry]]. Tarski's system would appear to be most within reach, especially if restricting to Tarski's first-order (elementary) version, rather than adding the second-order axiom which produces full Euclidean geometry.

Think about (or find a work describing) how to, from these axioms, introduce more familiar notation such as the line AB, the angle ∠ABC, the triangle ABC, etc.

Don't yet know if this is easy or hard, but [http://www.jimloy.com/geometry/17-gon.htm the 17-gon] might be a cute result to prove.

== First order logic todos ==

=== Worth proving? ===

* Not sure whether these are the most salient subst theorems (perhaps better to see what we end up needing), but some interesting-looking ones are:

=== More moving formulas where quantified variable is not free ===
*These two similar: [http://us.metamath.org/mpeuni/19.28.html 19.28] [http://us.metamath.org/mpeuni/19.45.html 19.45]

* Follow up on Foo -> FooNotFree rename per [[Interface talk:First-order logic]].

== Peano arithmetic ==
=== Theorems ===
Sample theorems from Hirst &amp; Hirst:
 7. Inequality is preserved by multiplication: x ≤ y → x · z ≤ y · z (lemul2, commuted)
 8. Strict inequality is preserved by nonzero multiplication:
    z ≠ 0 → (x < y → x · z < y · z)
 10. Inequalities can be multiplied: (w ≤ x ∧ y ≤ z) → w · y ≤ x · z

No zero divisors: a · b = 0 → (a = 0 ∨ b = 0)

More theorems:

* x ≠ 0 ↔ x > 0

== More axiomizations of propositional logic ==

=== Four-axiom variation of Principia axioms ===
Reducing the Principia axioms from 5 to 4 (unless I missed something, the change is to omit Assoc and change Add from <code>q → (p ∨ q)</code> to <code>q → (q ∨ p)</code>).  This is the axiomization used by [http://qedeq.org/0_03_11/doc/math/qedeq_logic_v1_en.pdf Elements of Mathematical Logic], Michael Meyling, August 2, 2008.

Stanley Burris (1997), [http://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/~snburris/htdocs/scav/hilbert/hilbert.html Hilbert and Ackermann's 1928 Logic Book], describing work by [[w:Paul Bernays|Bernays]] in 1926 and adopted by, for example, D. Hilbert and W. Ackermann, Grundzüge der theoretischen Logik. Springer-Verlag, 1928.

=== Robbins algebra ===
[[w:Robbins algebra]] and Huntington's axiom seem to form two axiomizations (unless I'm missing some detail in the translation from algebras to logical systems). We'd need some more axioms for =.  Conjunction and implication would be defined in terms of ∨ and ¬ in the usual Principia way I assume.
