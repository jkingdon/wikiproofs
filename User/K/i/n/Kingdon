== Naming convention ==
In [[Interface:Classical propositional calculus]], perhaps should rename detach2of2 to detachLastConjunct (as it also serves for 3 of 3, 4 of 4, etc) and detach2of3 to detachPenultimateConjunct (e.g. 3 of 4). However, this is a bit strange as detach1of(anything) is a different case (detach1of2 is not the same as detachPenultimateConjunct although the name detachPenultimateConjunct would suggest it would be).

== Geometry ==
Do we want/need/know how to get more familiar notation such as the line AB, the angle ∠ABC, the triangle △ABC, etc?

Don't yet know if this is easy or hard, but [http://www.jimloy.com/geometry/17-gon.htm the 17-gon] might be a cute result to prove.

=== Worth proving? ===

* Not sure whether these are the most salient subst theorems (perhaps better to see what we end up needing), but some interesting-looking ones are:

=== More moving formulas where quantified variable is not free ===
*These two similar: [http://us.metamath.org/mpeuni/19.28.html 19.28] [http://us.metamath.org/mpeuni/19.45.html 19.45]

* Follow up on Foo -> FooNotFree rename per [[Interface talk:First-order logic]].
