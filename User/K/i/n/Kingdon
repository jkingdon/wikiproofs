== Geometry ==
Do we want/need/know how to get more familiar notation such as the line AB, the angle ∠ABC, the triangle △ABC, etc?

Don't yet know if this is easy or hard, but [http://www.jimloy.com/geometry/17-gon.htm the 17-gon] might be a cute result to prove.

== First order logic todos ==

=== Worth proving? ===

* Not sure whether these are the most salient subst theorems (perhaps better to see what we end up needing), but some interesting-looking ones are:

=== More moving formulas where quantified variable is not free ===
*These two similar: [http://us.metamath.org/mpeuni/19.28.html 19.28] [http://us.metamath.org/mpeuni/19.45.html 19.45]

* Follow up on Foo -> FooNotFree rename per [[Interface talk:First-order logic]].
