=== sb8e ===
We need sb8e for LessThan.  Here's what it depends on in metamath. In most cases we need the analogues for object, not just the variable versions.

See sbcco in peano_thms.

=== Worth proving? ===

In general, stretch from 19.12 (currently at [http://us.metamath.org/mpeuni/mmtheorems11.html]) to qexmid (next page), but I don't know what is important and what isn't.

== Peano arithmetic ==
=== Theorems ===
Sample theorems from Hirst &amp; Hirst:
 4. Strict inequality is transitive: x < y → (y < z → x < z)
 5. Inequality is preserved by addition: x ≤ y → x + z ≤ y + z
 6. Strict inequality is preserved by addition: x < y → x + z < y + z
 7. Inequality is preserved by multiplication: x ≤ y → x · z ≤ y · z
 8. Strict inequality is preserved by nonzero multiplication:
    z ≠ 0 → (x < y → x · z < y · z)
 9. Inequalities can be added: (w ≤ x ∧ y ≤ z) → w + y ≤ x + z
 10. Inequalities can be multiplied: (w ≤ x ∧ y ≤ z) → w · y ≤ x · z

No zero divisors: a · b = 0 → (a = 0 ∨ b = 0)

Some definitions:

* x < y ↔ x ≤ y ∧ x ≠ y
* x > y ↔ y < x
* x ≥ y ↔ y ≤ x

More theorems:

* x ≠ 0 ↔ x > 0

We'll show that it has the [[w:Total order|expected properties of an order]].
* If a ≤ b and b ≤ a then a = b (antisymmetry);
* If a ≤ b and b ≤ c then a ≤ c (transitivity);
* a ≤ b or b ≤ a (totality). 
* (probably reflexivity too, although that is a consequence of totality)

Probably can base some of these on [http://code.google.com/p/ghilbert/source/browse/trunk/peano/peano_thms.gh peano_thms.gh]

=== nomenclature: combining vs combination ===
Shouldn't ThereExistsConjunctionCombining be called ThereExistsConjunctionCombination and likewise for any other *Combining theorems?

=== Basic arithmetic ===
[[Interface:Basic arithmetic]] does not currently have anything which needs to be proved with the ZeroNotSuccessor axiom (in fact, I'm pretty sure that modular arithmetic can model it). We should have one or more such. There is no largest number (e.g. <code>¬ ∃N ∀a a < N</code>)? Something about lack of cycles (can't keep adding one and get back where you started)? The total order properties would seem to suffice, and are more natural (the above are not aesthetically appealing, as they just restate ZeroNotSuccessor and are not, on the face of it, useful in algebra and the like).

== More axiomizations of propositional logic ==
Reducing the Principia axioms from 5 to 4 (unless I missed something, the change is to omit Assoc and change Add from <code>q → (p ∨ q)</code> to <code>q → (q ∨ p)</code>).  This is the axiomization used by [http://qedeq.org/0_03_11/doc/math/qedeq_logic_v1_en.pdf Elements of Mathematical Logic], Michael Meyling, August 2, 2008.
