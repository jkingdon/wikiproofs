In general, stretch from 19.12 (currently at [http://us.metamath.org/mpeuni/mmtheorems11.html]) to qexmid (next page), but I don't know what is important and what isn't.

==Peano theorems==
When I get to Peano arithmetic, here are some sample theorems:

 1. Addition is commutative: x + y = y + x
 2. Addition is associative: x + (y + z) = (x + y) + z
 3. Multiplication is distributive over addition: x · (y + z) = x · y + x · z
 4. Strict inequality is transitive: x < y → (y < z → x < z)
 5. Inequality is preserved by addition: x ≤ y → x + z ≤ y + z
 6. Strict inequality is preserved by addition: x < y → x + z < y + z
 7. Inequality is preserved by multiplication: x ≤ y → x · z ≤ y · z
 8. Strict inequality is preserved by nonzero multiplication:
    z = 0 → (x < y → x · z < y · z)
 9. Inequalities can be added: (w ≤ x ∧ y ≤ z) → w + y ≤ x + z
 10. Inequalities can be multiplied: (w ≤ x ∧ y ≤ z) → w · y ≤ x · z
