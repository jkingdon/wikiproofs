== Naming convention ==
In [[Interface:Classical propositional calculus]], perhaps should rename detach2of2 to detachLastConjunct (as it also serves for 3 of 3, 4 of 4, etc) and detach2of3 to detachPenultimateConjunct (e.g. 3 of 4). However, this is a bit strange as detach1of(anything) is a different case (detach1of2 is not the same as detachPenultimateConjunct although the name detachPenultimateConjunct would suggest it would be).

== Geometry ==
Do we want/need/know how to get more familiar notation such as the line AB, the angle ∠ABC, the triangle △ABC, etc?

Don't yet know if this is easy or hard, but [http://www.jimloy.com/geometry/17-gon.htm the 17-gon] might be a cute result to prove.

== First order logic todos ==

=== Worth proving? ===

* Not sure whether these are the most salient subst theorems (perhaps better to see what we end up needing), but some interesting-looking ones are:
:*[http://us.metamath.org/mpeuni/sbcom2.html sbcom2]
:*[http://us.metamath.org/mpeuni/sbid2v.html sbid2v]
:*[http://us.metamath.org/mpeuni/hbs1f.html hbs1f]
:*[http://us.metamath.org/mpeuni/hbsb2a.html hbsb2a]

=== More moving formulas where quantified variable is not free ===
*These two similar: [http://us.metamath.org/mpeuni/19.28.html 19.28] [http://us.metamath.org/mpeuni/19.45.html 19.45]

* Follow up on Foo -> FooNotFree rename per [[Interface talk:First-order logic]].

== More axiomizations of propositional logic ==

=== Four-axiom variation of Principia axioms ===
Reducing the Principia axioms from 5 to 4 (unless I missed something, the change is to omit Assoc and change Add from <code>q → (p ∨ q)</code> to <code>q → (q ∨ p)</code>).  This is the axiomization used by [http://qedeq.org/0_03_11/doc/math/qedeq_logic_v1_en.pdf Elements of Mathematical Logic], Michael Meyling, August 2, 2008.

Stanley Burris (1997), [http://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/~snburris/htdocs/scav/hilbert/hilbert.html Hilbert and Ackermann's 1928 Logic Book], describing work by [[w:Paul Bernays|Bernays]] in 1926 and adopted by, for example, D. Hilbert and W. Ackermann, Grundzüge der theoretischen Logik. Springer-Verlag, 1928.

=== Robbins algebra ===
[[w:Robbins algebra]] and Huntington's axiom seem to form two axiomizations (unless I'm missing some detail in the translation from algebras to logical systems). We'd need some more axioms for =.  Conjunction and implication would be defined in terms of ∨ and ¬ in the usual Principia way I assume.
