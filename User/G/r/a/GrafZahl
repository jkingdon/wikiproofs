== TODO ==
* Main page: more JHilbert info
* Help pages: JHilbert manual
* Redesign of JHilbert with associativity and precedence
* Propositional logic:
** The several ≈Åukasiewicz axiom systems: two Sheffer systems, and the three-proposition classical propositional calculus
** Wajsberg's axiom
** Possibly some of Branden Fitelson's [http://fitelson.org/ar.html stuff]?
** Meredith
** "Standard propositional calculus", as a toolbox for further developments. Started interface in [[Interface:Classical propositional calculus]], should be derived from Principia Mathematica or other stuff. [[/Principia number mapping]]
* First-order logic

== Definitions ==

* [[/Botched attempt to prove JHilbert definition soundness]]
* [[/Definitions in JHilbert]]
* [[/unsound-def.gh]] demonstration of unsoundness in Ghilbert with the old definition mechanism as suggested by [[User:CarlWitty/bad-const-defn.mm]]. As of Feb&nbsp;2010, Raph is developing a new, conservative definition mechanism.
