The purpose of this page is first and foremost to precisely specify the various safe definition proposals floating around in the *Hilbert multiverse, so that interested folks (including myself (GrafZahl), for I'm still struggling to get all this stuff into my head) can finally grok them all.

Secondly, it would be nice if all involved parties could agree on a common internal mechanism to handle definitions, that is, the definition mechanism in Ghilbert/JHilbert/whatever are identical from an ''abstract'' point of view, not necessarily in command syntax. I have started to write a [https://github.com/TheCount/hilbert-kernel library] implementing the abstract mechanics of JHilbert. If we put all the hard metalogical stuff into this library and then use the library for every JHilbert-like application, we'll have to verify its correctness only once. For example, I expect that in the end there will be two implementations of JHilbert on this site; a JavaScript "JHilbert console" helping users compose proofs using their own processing resources, and the server-side verifier.

What is discussed here:
* An "abbreviation" mechanism, that is a heavily trimmed-down version of the current (broken) definition mechanism. It has automatic folding and unfolding and is intended to be used when the user ''wants'' such automatic folding and unfolding.
* Carl Witty's statement-backed definition proposal.
* Raph Levien's proof-backed definition proposal (apparently already implemented in Ghilbert[http://ghilbert.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/]).

I deliberately dubbed the last two items thus, for that is what the users sees first upon encountering the respective <code>defthm</code> command. I am quite aware that there may be significant philosophical differences between these two proposals (in particular the free vs. distinct variables interpretation) which may render a [[#Confluence|confluence]] of both approaches moot. That is, it may not even make sense to attempt to drive both views with the same internal mechanism. (As far as I know, there is currently no implementation of Carl's proposal, while Raph's is already in Ghilbert. Still, currently I like Carl's proposal better. But that may be just because at the moment, Carl's proposal is the one I understand better.)
