This is part of a series of modules which prove a variety of geometrical theorems starting with Tarski's axioms for geometry. We follow the formalization of Julien Narboux<ref>The formal proofs are at [http://www.lix.polytechnique.fr/Labo/Julien.Narboux/tarski.html Formalization of Tarski's geometry in the Coq proof assistant] and are described in Julien Narboux (2007), "[http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.158.8614 Mechanical Theorem Proving in Tarski’s Geometry]", F. Botana and T. Recio (Eds.): ADG 2006, LNAI 4869, pp. 139–156</ref> which itself closely follows a treatise by Schwabhäuser, Szmielew, and Tarski.<ref>W. Schwabhäuser, W Szmielew, and A. Tarski (1983), ''Metamathematische Methoden in der Geometrie'', ISBN 0387129588</ref>

This page is primarily devoted to the proof of one theorem, <code>A ≠ B ∧ between A B C ∧ between A B D → between A C D ∨ between A D C</code>. This is called outer connectivity for betweenness by Narboux<ref>Narboux (2007), page 144</ref> and Givant.<ref>Tarski and Givant (1999), page 186</ref> It was once considered an axiom of Tarski's system, but was proved from the other axioms by Gupta in 1965<ref>Tarski and Givant (1999), page 190</ref><ref>Narboux (2007), citing Gupta, H.N.: Contributions to the axiomatic foundations of geometry. PhD thesis, University of California, Berkley (1965)</ref>

The proof is not simple; Givant calls it "rather involved" and Narboux devotes two and a half pages to an informal proof (and an explanation of part of the formal proof).<ref>Narboux (2007), pages 151-153</ref>

We import the theorems of [[Interface:Classical propositional calculus|propositional logic]] and [[Interface:First-order logic with quantifiability|predicate logic]], and the [[Interface:Triangle congruence|geometry results so far]] and define some variables:
<jh>
import (CLASSICAL Interface:Classical_propositional_calculus () ())
import (FIRSTORDER Interface:First-order_logic_with_quantifiability (CLASSICAL) ())
import (START Interface:Triangle_congruence (CLASSICAL FIRSTORDER) ())

var (formula φ)
var (point x y z w u v A B C D E P Q A′ B′ C′ D′ B″ C″)
var (point x′ y′ z′ w′ u′)
var (variable a b b′ c c′ d′ b″ c″)
</jh>

== Export ==
We now export to [[Interface:Connectivity for betweenness]].
<jh>
#export (RESULTS Interface:Connectivity_for_betweenness (CLASSICAL FIRSTORDER) ())
</jh>

Also, since this page is currently the last in the (in-progress) series on basic geometry, we export to [[Interface:Basic geometry]].
<jh>
export (GEOMETRY Interface:Basic_geometry (CLASSICAL FIRSTORDER) ())
</jh>
