This is part of a series of modules which prove a variety of geometrical theorems starting with Tarski's axioms for geometry. We follow the formalization of Julien Narboux<ref>The formal proofs are at [http://www.lix.polytechnique.fr/Labo/Julien.Narboux/tarski.html Formalization of Tarski's geometry in the Coq proof assistant] and are described in Julien Narboux (2007), "[http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.158.8614 Mechanical Theorem Proving in Tarski’s Geometry]", F. Botana and T. Recio (Eds.): ADG 2006, LNAI 4869, pp. 139–156</ref> which itself closely follows a treatise by Schwabhäuser, Szmielew, and Tarski.<ref>W. Schwabhäuser, W Szmielew, and A. Tarski (1983), ''Metamathematische Methoden in der Geometrie'', ISBN 0387129588</ref>

This page is primarily devoted to the proof of one theorem, <code>A ≠ B ∧ between A B C ∧ between A B D → between A C D ∨ between A D C</code>. This is called outer connectivity for betweenness by Narboux<ref>Narboux (2007), page 144</ref> and Givant.<ref>Tarski and Givant (1999), page 186</ref> It was once considered an axiom of Tarski's system, but was proved from the other axioms by Gupta in 1965<ref>Tarski and Givant (1999), page 190</ref><ref>Narboux (2007), citing Gupta, H.N.: Contributions to the axiomatic foundations of geometry. PhD thesis, University of California, Berkley (1965)</ref>

The proof is not simple; Givant calls it "rather involved" and Narboux devotes two and a half pages to an informal proof (and an explanation of part of the formal proof).<ref>Narboux (2007), pages 151-153</ref>

We import the theorems of [[Interface:Classical propositional calculus|propositional logic]] and [[Interface:First-order logic with quantifiability|predicate logic]], and the [[Interface:Collinearity|geometry results so far]] and define some variables:

[[File:outer connectivity for betweenness 1|thumb|right|construction of C′, D′, B′, and B″]]

Here's an outline of the proof, illustrating which points we construct but leaving most of the detailed line segment congruences for the detailed formal proof.

We first construct <code>C′ and D′</code> extending the line segments <code>A D</code> and <code>A C</code> by a distance of <code>C D</code> in both cases. Eventually, the proof will show that <code>C = C′</code> or <code>D = D′</code>.

Then extend the line segments <code>A C′</code> and <code>A D′</code> to points <code>B′</code> and <code>B″</code> by distances of <code>C B</code> and <code>D B</code>. The result of this construction is that the distance from <code>B</code> is the same to either <code>B′</code> or <code>B″</code> and thus we can conclude that <code>B′ = B″</code>.

[[File:outer connectivity for betweenness 2|thumb|right|construction of E]]
The point <code>E</code> lies at the intersection of <code>C C′</code> and <code>D D′</code>.

At this point we assume <code>C ≠ C′</code> and will deduce from that <code>D = D′</code>.

[[File:outer connectivity for betweenness 3|thumb|right|construction of P, Q, and R]]
Extend <code>C′ C</code> by the distance <code>C D′</code> to a point <code>P</code>. Extend <code>D′ C</code> by the distance <code>C E</code> to a point <code>R</code>. Extend <code>P R</code> by the distance <code>R P</code> to a point <code>Q</code>.

[[File:outer connectivity for betweenness 4|thumb|right|D′ D ≡ P Q and C P ≡ C Q]]
By some congruences we can show first <code>D′ D ≡ P Q</code>, which we'll need at the end of the proof, and <code>C P ≡ C Q</code>, which leads to the next step.

[[File:outer connectivity for betweenness 5|thumb|right|B P ≡ B Q and B′ P ≡ B′ Q]]
We can now show that <code>B</code> and <code>B′</code> are each equidistant from <code>P</code> and <code>Q</code>.

TODO: can we expand on the motivation for this, or how it leads to the next step?

[[File:outer connectivity for betweenness 6|thumb|right|C′ P ≡ C′ Q]]
Similarly, C′ is also equidistant from <code>P</code> and <code>Q</code>.

TODO: What is the picture and the brief summary of the last steps (P P ≡ P Q, P = Q, and D = D′)?

== Construction of C′, D′, B′, and B″ ==
[[File:outer connectivity for betweenness 1|thumb|right|construction of C′, D′, B′, and B″]]
We construct <code>c′</code> such that <code>between A D c′ ∧ D c′ ≡ C D</code> and <code>d′</code> such that <code>between A C d′ ∧ C d′ ≡ C D</code>.

Then we construct <code>b′</code> such that <code>between A c′ b′ ∧ c′ b′ ≡ C B</code> and <code>b″</code> such that <code>between A d′ b″ ∧ d′ b″ ≡ D B</code>.

The following lemma embodies these constructions, and a bit of rearrangement of the quantifiers.

      ((between A C d′) ∧ (C d′ ≡ C D))) ∧
      ((between A c′ b′) ∧ (c′ b′ ≡ C B))) ∧
      ((between A d′ b″) ∧ (d′ b″ ≡ D B))) ∧
      (((A ≠ B) ∧ (between A B C)) ∧ (between A B D)))))))) (
))
</jh>

== Under construction ==
{{under construction}}
A ≠ B ∧ between A B C ∧ between A B D →
  ∃ c′ ∃ d′ ∃ b′ ∃ b″ (stuff1)

(stuff1) → ∃ e (stuff2)
    between C e C′ ∧ between D e D′

(stuff2) ∧ C ≠ C′ → ∃ p ∃ q ∃ r (stuff3)

(stuff3) → D = D′

Want (stuff2) → (C ≠ C′ → D = D′)

== Export ==
We now export to [[Interface:Connectivity for betweenness]].
