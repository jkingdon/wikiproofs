== Ability to move subst across logical connectives ==

I'm moving the following from the main page to here as we don't need them yet, and don't prove them.

We can move <code>subst</code> across logical connectives:(ref)[http://us.metamath.org/mpeuni/sbn.html sbn], [http://us.metamath.org/mpeuni/sbor.html sbor], [http://us.metamath.org/mpeuni/sban.html sban], [http://us.metamath.org/mpeuni/sbim.html sbim], and [http://us.metamath.org/mpeuni/sbbi.html sbbi] in metamath's set.mm, accessed February 28, 2010(/ref)

stmt (SubstNegation () () ((subst y x (¬ φ)) ↔ (¬ (subst y x φ))))
stmt (SubstDisjunction () () ((subst y x (φ ∨ ψ)) ↔ ((subst y x φ) ∨ (subst y x ψ))))
stmt (SubstConjunction () () ((subst y x (φ ∧ ψ)) ↔ ((subst y x φ) ∧ (subst y x ψ))))
stmt (SubstImplication () () ((subst y x (φ → ψ)) ↔ ((subst y x φ) → (subst y x ψ))))
stmt (SubstBiconditional () () ((subst y x (φ ↔ ψ)) ↔ ((subst y x φ) ↔ (subst y x ψ))))

== First-order logic without equality ==

In an email, [[User:GrafZahl]] asks me whether we should have first-order logic without equality.  Although one of the nice things about the module/interface system is that differing theories can coexist on the wiki, first-order logic without equality presents at least two problems:
#It is not nearly as widely used as first-order logic with equality for purposes like being the basis for set theory, arithmetic, etc.
#JHilbert, metamath, and GHilbert are not currently able to handle it. First-order logic without equality still has proper substitution, but we don't currently have any way of defining proper substitution in any way other than in terms of equality.
The second is a show-stopper; the first is just an estimate of how important it is to address this. [[User:Kingdon|Kingdon]] 14:08, 27 April 2010 (UTC)

== ForAllAddRemove -> ForAllAddRemoveNotFree ==

We currently have a fairly extensive theory based on <code>is-not-free-in</code>. This is powerful/beautiful enough that I'm not yet suggesting that we get rid of it (or move it out to another interface), but for practical purposes it seems like versions of theorems like <code>ForAllAddRemove</code> with distinct variable constraints, rather than explicit freeness hypotheses, are more useful. My proposed course of action is to rename the theorems with explicit freeness hypotheses to have "NotFree" at the end.  For example, <code>ForAllAddRemove</code> to <code>ForAllAddRemoveNotFree</code>. Then the plain names, e.g., <code>ForAllAddRemove</code>, are available for the distinct variable versions. This parallels some of the naming conventions in metamath (they add "v" for the distinct version, e.g. [http://us.metamath.org/mpeuni/exbid.html exbid] versus [http://us.metamath.org/mpeuni/exbidv.html exbidv], or add "f" for the freeness hypothesis version). I'll hold off on a mass rename until people have had a little time to respond, but I plan on using this convention for newly proved theorems (and eventually get around to the mass rename, so we can be back to a consistent convention).
