Question:  Is "(x is-not-free-in x = x)" true or false in this axiomatization? [[User:Norm|Norm]] 19:05, 7 March 2012 (UTC)

: Neither it nor its negation are provable. At least, that was my intention. This might seem like an odd choice to make (in the sense of "shouldn't we clarify this one way or the other?"), but it doesn't seem like being able to prove or disprove the above formula is needed for one's ability to use free variables the way one needs to. At least, that has been my experience to date. [[User:Kingdon|Kingdon]] 05:49, 8 March 2012 (UTC)

:: Actually, it appears we can prove (x is-not-free-in (x = x)).  In predicate calculus we can prove ( ( ∀ x x = x ) ↔ x = x ).  By BoundForAllNotFree, (x is-not-free-in (∀ x x = x)).  From buildNotFree, (x is-not-free-in x = x) follows. This shows that "is-not-free-in" is slightly different from the usual literature definition.  This isn't necessarily inconsistent, but more likely merely a different definition that in the end will lead to the same theorems (in which "is-not-free-in" doesn't occur).
