== (Non-)distinct variables ==

The idea at [[User:Norm]], about specifying variables that are not distinct as opposed to ones that are, is an interesting idea, and seems like it might work if, as suggested, it applies to variables and not terms and formulas (to avoid a lot of not-distinct declarations just to cover theorems like A + B = B + A or just about any theorem not involving quantifiers). As for JHilbert work in general, the source code is  [https://github.com/TheCount/jhilbert on github] ([https://github.com/jkingdon/jhilbert my fork]) and contributions are certainly welcome. I've also been working on making wikiproofs into a testsuite, by letting one download wikiproofs and then run it all through the verifier, expecting everything to verify except where flagged by [[Template:error expected]], in which case it would be expected to fail. For me, the #1 priority is [[Wikiproofs:JHilbert definition soundness]] but there are plenty of other verifier projects which could be worthwhile, and we certainly are soliciting volunteers.
