== Welcome ==

Hello Julian, and welcome to Wikiproofs. You appear to have acquainted yourself with JHilbert already. Its relatively simple metalanguage is still somewhat cumbersome to use with certain systems, including MIU. There are plans to improve the JHilbert parser so it can interpret more natural representations. But do feel free to place your contributions in the main namespaces. If you have any questions, do not hesitate to contact me on my [[User talk:GrafZahl|talk page]] or the [[WP:TEA|tearoom]].--[[User:GrafZahl|GrafZahl]]&nbsp;([[User talk:GrafZahl|talk]]) 21:09, 30 August 2011 (UTC)

:Hi GrafZahl, and thank you for the welcome.  I'm new to JHilbert, but I find its simplicity a very good property. In addition, the integration to the MediaWiki interface is seamless. I think that combining wiki-collaborative work and formal proofs is a nice idea. --[[User:Julian|Julian]] 00:52, 31 August 2011 (UTC)

::It certainly is :) Yet, there are so many things still to do, and I'm still quite occupied with real-life issues. If you're interested in JHilbert development: there is a (slightly dated) [[Wikiproofs:JHilbert development|JHilbert development]] page, the github repositories of [[User:Kingdon|Kingdon]] and me [https://github.com/jkingdon] [https://github.com/thecount], and the [[mw:Extension:JHilbert|JHilbert Mediawiki extension page]].--[[User:GrafZahl|GrafZahl]]&nbsp;([[User talk:GrafZahl|talk]]) 10:11, 31 August 2011 (UTC)

:It is interesting to see your MIU adaptation. I hadn't thought about what MIU would look like in JHilbert, and seems to me that the features which make JHilbert awkward for MIU are also the features that enable things like the semi-safe definitions we have now (and eventually, the fully safe definitions we want). One of the trickiest things in metamath, for example, is the way that defining a syntax carelessly can render the system inconsistent. This is related to the free-form syntax which makes it easy to express MIU in metamath (which can be found at http://us.metamath.org/metamath/miu.mm or appendix D of the metamath book). As for whether any of this is related to "simple metalanguage", I'm not sure. I tried googling for MIU in coq or Isabelle and I didn't find anything, and I'd have to learn more of those systems to try to write one.

:As for stuff to do with wikiproofs/JHilbert, there's also [[:Category:Pages needing cleanup]] but of course you should feel free to find any project which interests you. And do ask if there is anything we can do to help. [[User:Kingdon|Kingdon]] 01:22, 1 September 2011 (UTC)
