== Welcome ==

Hello Julian, and welcome to Wikiproofs. You appear to have acquainted yourself with JHilbert already. Its relatively simple metalanguage is still somewhat cumbersome to use with certain systems, including MIU. There are plans to improve the JHilbert parser so it can interpret more natural representations. But do feel free to place your contributions in the main namespaces. If you have any questions, do not hesitate to contact me on my [[User talk:GrafZahl|talk page]] or the [[WP:TEA|tearoom]].--[[User:GrafZahl|GrafZahl]]&nbsp;([[User talk:GrafZahl|talk]]) 21:09, 30 August 2011 (UTC)
