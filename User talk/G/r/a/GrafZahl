== sessions ==

Is there something wrong with the way session data is being stored?  If I log in, I'm just logged in for one page view, and clicking anything returns me to not logged in. It seems to work for wikipedia, so I don't think it is a setting with cookies in my browser. Kingdon. [[Special:Contributions/97.73.64.167|97.73.64.167]] 01:38, 29 August 2010 (UTC)

:Hmm, WFM. I haven't changed anything regarding the Wiki configuration. Except for the recent OOM problem and reboot, nothing out of the ordinary happened. I see nothing in the server logs, too. Have you changed the cookie settings of your browser recently? Like accidentally clicking "disable cookies from this domain" or something? I have four cookies: <code>wikidbToken</code>, <code>wikidbUserID</code>, <code>wikidbUserName</code>, and <code>wikidb_session</code>. Maybe checking "keep me logged in" on the login page helps? I've enabled MediaWiki's debug mode for now. If this problem persists, we may find something in the debug log.--[[User:GrafZahl|GrafZahl]] 09:03, 29 August 2010 (UTC)

::Does it matter that every request comes in from a different IP address? If so, it is (presumably) peculiar to the internet connection that I'm on for the next few days, which would explain why it just started happening. If this is the deal, seems worth trying to cater to people on such connections, even if in my own case it is only temporary.
