== sessions ==

Is there something wrong with the way session data is being stored?  If I log in, I'm just logged in for one page view, and clicking anything returns me to not logged in. It seems to work for wikipedia, so I don't think it is a setting with cookies in my browser. Kingdon. [[Special:Contributions/97.73.64.167|97.73.64.167]] 01:38, 29 August 2010 (UTC)

:Hmm, WFM. I haven't changed anything regarding the Wiki configuration. Except for the recent OOM problem and reboot, nothing out of the ordinary happened. I see nothing in the server logs, too. Have you changed the cookie settings of your browser recently? Like accidentally clicking "disable cookies from this domain" or something? I have four cookies: <code>wikidbToken</code>, <code>wikidbUserID</code>, <code>wikidbUserName</code>, and <code>wikidb_session</code>. Maybe checking "keep me logged in" on the login page helps? I've enabled MediaWiki's debug mode for now. If this problem persists, we may find something in the debug log.--[[User:GrafZahl|GrafZahl]] 09:03, 29 August 2010 (UTC)

::Does it matter that every request comes in from a different IP address? If so, it is (presumably) peculiar to the internet connection that I'm on for the next few days, which would explain why it just started happening. If this is the deal, seems worth trying to cater to people on such connections, even if in my own case it is only temporary. [[Special:Contributions/97.73.64.174|97.73.64.174]] 12:05, 29 August 2010 (UTC)

:::I don't think it should. After all, the cookies should be in your browser and should be sent on every request regardless of your IP. But then, maybe there is some security mechanism in PHP to guard against session hijacking. Anyway, I've disabled MediaWiki's cookie check. That won't help you, though, if your cookies are really, truly lost. I also don't know what Wikipedia does different from Wikiproofs that could prevent your cookies from working here, while they work there. Any ideas on how to change the MediaWiki configuration to keep session loss from happening to you without jeopardising user security are appreciated.--[[User:GrafZahl|GrafZahl]] 15:20, 29 August 2010 (UTC)

::::I'd only expect the IP address to matter if something were explicitly checking for it. I didn't see any settings at [http://php.net/manual/en/ref.session.php#ini.session.save-path] or [http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual:Configuration_settings] to do that, so maybe the changing IP address is unrelated. I did verify via [http://ngrep.sourceforge.net/ ngrep] that my browser is sending cookies (wikidbUserID, wikidbUserName, wikidbToken, and wikidb_session), so it seems to have something to do with whether the server is accepting them and finding a session with them. As for [http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual:$wgDisableCookieCheck $wgDisableCookieCheck], I can't really tell what that one does from the manual. I did have another idea: perhaps there is some kind of firewall (either at my host's house, or his ISP) which sometimes strips cookies (or something like that)? There would have to be something about it which is specific to wikiproofs rather than the other sites I've tried (linkedin, meetup, at least), so I'm not sure how likely that is. I think I'm out of obvious ideas, so I think I'm at the point of "see if it goes away when I'm on a different internet connection".

:::::Tunneling the connection through an SSH connection to an ISP account of mine does solve the problem.  So I guess it is some kind of firewall/proxy/etc (?). Anyway, thanks for your help and I guess we can consider this resolved. [[User:Kingdon|Kingdon]] 20:42, 29 August 2010 (UTC)

::::::I'm also out of ideas. Nice to hear that you have a means of making it work for you again. I'm re-enabling the cookie check. According to some MediaWiki mailing list entries, it's a convenience check only, to inform users of cookie loss as soon as possible. Apparently, this check can misfire with certain browser/OS combinations. The debug log is pretty useless because it's lacking timestamps, but I finally found <code>Session user ID (0) and cookie user ID (4) don't match!</code>. (The relevant code is on line 817 in <code>User.php</code>.) I have not investigated why these didn't match in your case. Wikipedia uses a different set of cookies due to SUL. Hence our problem might not apply to Wikipedia. It might also be some PHP session problem at Wikiproof's end.--[[User:GrafZahl|GrafZahl]] 10:45, 30 August 2010 (UTC)

== publicity ==

I had a nice talk with an old professor of mine, Michael Henle, and he thought that if I wrote a two paragraph summary of wikiproofs for the journal he edits, they'd likely publish it. Sounds like a good idea to me. The pitch would likely be as something to use in education. The only reason I can think of not to do it is if we want wikiproofs to be more "ready" first, but I was thinking of pitching it in terms of ''contributing'' to wikiproofs being the educational thing.  I figure the more people hear of wikiproofs, the greater the chance that one of them will have the time to fix definitions, or get set theory moving faster, or prove all those compass-and-straightedge geometry theorems which I kind of doubt I'll have time for. (At least in the US, geometry is perhaps the most obvious hook for educational use of the site, as that is where they teach proofs - although the axiomizations of Hilbert, Tarski, or Birkhoff might be a bit far from the way things are taught in Euclid, or modern textbooks). For more on the journal, see "Media Highlights" at [http://www.maa.org/pubs/cmj_info.html].

Prof. Henle also showed me the historical marker to Quine which is now sitting outside the building where his office is, which was quite a welcome surprise, since I'd vaugely been thinking of looking up the Quine paper which is cited in metamath.

Anyway, let me know what you think about the journal. [[User:Kingdon|Kingdon]] 21:07, 30 August 2010 (UTC)

:I read a few articles of the free first 2009 issue of the journal (no Media Highlights were available for free, however) and it looks interesting.
:Indeed, one of my motivations for creating this site was educational in nature: the ability to write down a machine-verifiable theory with the possibility of inserting explanatory wikitext everywhere. This is mentioned briefly on [[mw:Extension:JHilbert#Usage]], but it should get at least a paragraph or so on [[WP:ABOUT]] and possibly the [[Main Page]]. It's one of the things intended to enhance the metamath experience. In metamath, you only get an introductory text and then one whole database item in one chunk. The other important educational factor is, as you mention, the ability to contribute new theories and proofs. I think that both aspects are very important.
:Alas, these features are far from being ready yet. Core issues aside (the currently implemented definition mechanism is ''broken'', no denying it), both JHilbert input and output are in need of certain improvements in order to be of real educational value. The JHilbert renderer is, at this point, merely a glorified syntax highlighter. Metamath is miles ahead of Wikiproofs in this respect. Ideally, the output should display the top of the expression stack after each statement step, and have some JavaScript gizmos to explore the entire proof state on request. As for input, I like Raph's "instant gratification" idea (to be even more instant in proof checking than pressing the preview button, also with JavaScript). In total, the JHilbert integration with MediaWiki is still very, very ad hoc.
:Nevertheless, I don't think we should miss this opportunity and try to publish your short article. However, for the sake of honesty, I think we should highlight at least the following points:
:* currently unfixed core bugs, including an unsound definition mechanism,
:* the current, unfinished, state of JHilbert's tools regarding contribution and presentation makes the site more interesting for educators willing to take up some of the tasks and meta-tasks which must be completed to make Wikiproofs a worthwhile educational experience, rather than for educatees.
:What do you think?

:Finally, I thank you once again, for taking the initiative to increase public awareness of Wikiproofs at a time when I myself have but little time to contribute. Thank you! I also understand that Prof. Henle has taken the time to have a glance at the Wikiproofs site, so I thank him, too.
:As for Quine, let me tell you an anecdote about a revelational moment in my life. I've been casually interested in the foundations of mathematics since my first university semester. It didn't take very long until I found Nicod's article [[s:A Reduction in the number of the Primitive Propositions of Logic|A Reduction in the number of the Primitive Propositions of Logic]], where he builds the classical propositional calculus from one connective, one axiom and one rule of inference. One day, I worked through the entire paper. It wasn't too easy. I scribbled a veritable stack of papers full, redoing the proofs. But it wasn't too hard, either. It took me the whole day, but not longer. Therefore, I was very surprised that there was sort of a small controversy about the correctness of Nicod's paper. The (partially justified) criticism was that Nicod's proof style was rather terse, and sometimes did not follow the logical order. One Prof. JÃ¶rgensen attempted to re-render Nicod's proof in a style similar to what you would feed a modern proof verifier. Alas, he got confused by some of the abbreviations and made improper substitutions in the proof of <code>(t | (t | t))</code>. (The error actually made it into a textbook.) I checked my notes and found I had not made such an error. The error was finally cleared up by Quine in 1932, when he wrote a paper with the sole purpose to correctly re-render the proof of <code>(t | (t | t))</code> in PM style. So I wondered: why did it take the great Quine to explain Nicod's proof to the general public, twelve years after it was published, when the same proof became clear to me within a single day? The answer is, I believe, ''hindsight''. Before I got Nicod's paper into my hands, I had already read several expository text books and course scripts on formal logic. In fact, it was in a footnote in one of the course scripts where I found the reference to Nicod's article. These beginner's texts had taught me how formal mathematics works, had warned me about common fallacies, before I even knew of the existence of Nicod's axiom. The people in the 1920s, when formal logic was still a very new thing, didn't have these advantages. To grasp a genuinely new idea such as Nicod's must have been much more difficult for people back then than it is for us beginner's-exposition-spoiled folks today. It's also one reason why I believe in the importance of an educationally valuable presentation. It saves time and is less likely to leave you with misconceptions.

::In two paragraphs I won't have the space to go into any details on what's missing from wikiproofs, but I'll see if there is a natural way to work in the bit about mixing informal text with the proofs (which I agree is important, including diagrams, see for example the SVG diagram under Pasch's axiom at [[Interface:Tarski's geometry axioms]], without which I certainly can't follow all the u's and v's). I figure the whole thing is pretty tentative until I hear more about their style guidelines, a somewhat more solid statement of whether they want to run the piece, etc, but I have written back to Prof. Henle to keep the ball rolling.
