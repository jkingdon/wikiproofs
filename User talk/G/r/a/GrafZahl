== sessions ==

Is there something wrong with the way session data is being stored?  If I log in, I'm just logged in for one page view, and clicking anything returns me to not logged in. It seems to work for wikipedia, so I don't think it is a setting with cookies in my browser. Kingdon. [[Special:Contributions/97.73.64.167|97.73.64.167]] 01:38, 29 August 2010 (UTC)

:Hmm, WFM. I haven't changed anything regarding the Wiki configuration. Except for the recent OOM problem and reboot, nothing out of the ordinary happened. I see nothing in the server logs, too. Have you changed the cookie settings of your browser recently? Like accidentally clicking "disable cookies from this domain" or something? I have four cookies: <code>wikidbToken</code>, <code>wikidbUserID</code>, <code>wikidbUserName</code>, and <code>wikidb_session</code>. Maybe checking "keep me logged in" on the login page helps? I've enabled MediaWiki's debug mode for now. If this problem persists, we may find something in the debug log.--[[User:GrafZahl|GrafZahl]] 09:03, 29 August 2010 (UTC)

::Does it matter that every request comes in from a different IP address? If so, it is (presumably) peculiar to the internet connection that I'm on for the next few days, which would explain why it just started happening. If this is the deal, seems worth trying to cater to people on such connections, even if in my own case it is only temporary.

:::I don't think it should. After all, the cookies should be in your browser and should be sent on every request regardless of your IP. But then, maybe there is some security mechanism in PHP to guard against session hijacking. Anyway, I've disabled MediaWiki's cookie check. That won't help you, though, if your cookies are really, truly lost. I also don't know what Wikipedia does different from Wikiproofs that could prevent your cookies from working here, while they work there. Any ideas on how to change the MediaWiki configuration to keep session loss from happening to you without jeopardising user security are appreciated.--[[User:GrafZahl|GrafZahl]] 15:20, 29 August 2010 (UTC)

::::I'd only expect the IP address to matter if something were explicitly checking for it. I didn't see any settings at [http://php.net/manual/en/ref.session.php#ini.session.save-path] or [http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual:Configuration_settings] to do that, so maybe the changing IP address is unrelated. I did verify via [http://ngrep.sourceforge.net/ ngrep] that my browser is sending cookies (wikidbUserID, wikidbUserName, wikidbToken, and wikidb_session), so it seems to have something to do with whether the server is accepting them and finding a session with them. As for [http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual:$wgDisableCookieCheck $wgDisableCookieCheck], I can't really tell what that one does from the manual. I did have another idea: perhaps there is some kind of firewall (either at my host's house, or his ISP) which sometimes strips cookies (or something like that)? There would have to be something about it which is specific to wikiproofs rather than the other sites I've tried (linkedin, meetup, at least), so I'm not sure how likely that is. I think I'm out of obvious ideas, so I think I'm at the point of "see if it goes away when I'm on a different internet connection".

:::::Tunneling the connection through an SSH connection to an ISP account of mine does solve the problem.  So I guess it is some kind of firewall/proxy/etc (?). Anyway, thanks for your help and I guess we can consider this resolved. [[User:Kingdon|Kingdon]] 20:42, 29 August 2010 (UTC)

::::::I'm also out of ideas. Nice to hear that you have a means of making it work for you again. I'm re-enabling the cookie check. According to some MediaWiki mailing list entries, it's a convenience check only, to inform users of cookie loss as soon as possible. Apparently, this check can misfire with certain browser/OS combinations. The debug log is pretty useless because it's lacking timestamps, but I finally found <code>Session user ID (0) and cookie user ID (4) don't match!</code>. (The relevant code is on line 817 in <code>User.php</code>.) I have not investigated why these didn't match in your case. Wikipedia uses a different set of cookies due to SUL. Hence our problem might not apply to Wikipedia. It might also be some PHP session problem at Wikiproof's end.--[[User:GrafZahl|GrafZahl]] 10:45, 30 August 2010 (UTC)

== publicity ==

I had a nice talk with an old professor of mine, Michael Henle, and he thought that if I wrote a two paragraph summary of wikiproofs for the journal he edits, they'd likely publish it. Sounds like a good idea to me. The pitch would likely be as something to use in education. The only reason I can think of not to do it is if we want wikiproofs to be more "ready" first, but I was thinking of pitching it in terms of ''contributing'' to wikiproofs being the educational thing.  I figure the more people hear of wikiproofs, the greater the chance that one of them will have the time to fix definitions, or get set theory moving faster, or prove all those compass-and-straightedge geometry theorems which I kind of doubt I'll have time for. (At least in the US, geometry is perhaps the most obvious hook for educational use of the site, as that is where they teach proofs - although the axiomizations of Hilbert, Tarski, or Birkhoff might be a bit far from the way things are taught in Euclid, or modern textbooks). For more on the journal, see "Media Highlights" at [http://www.maa.org/pubs/cmj_info.html].

Prof. Henle also showed me the historical marker to Quine which is now sitting outside the building where his office is, which was quite a welcome surprise, since I'd vaugely been thinking of looking up the Quine paper which is cited in metamath.

Anyway, let me know what you think about the journal. [[User:Kingdon|Kingdon]] 21:07, 30 August 2010 (UTC)
