== sessions ==

Is there something wrong with the way session data is being stored?  If I log in, I'm just logged in for one page view, and clicking anything returns me to not logged in. It seems to work for wikipedia, so I don't think it is a setting with cookies in my browser. Kingdon. [[Special:Contributions/97.73.64.167|97.73.64.167]] 01:38, 29 August 2010 (UTC)

:Hmm, WFM. I haven't changed anything regarding the Wiki configuration. Except for the recent OOM problem and reboot, nothing out of the ordinary happened. I see nothing in the server logs, too. Have you changed the cookie settings of your browser recently? Like accidentally clicking "disable cookies from this domain" or something? I have four cookies: <code>wikidbToken</code>, <code>wikidbUserID</code>, <code>wikidbUserName</code>, and <code>wikidb_session</code>. Maybe checking "keep me logged in" on the login page helps? I've enabled MediaWiki's debug mode for now. If this problem persists, we may find something in the debug log.--[[User:GrafZahl|GrafZahl]] 09:03, 29 August 2010 (UTC)
