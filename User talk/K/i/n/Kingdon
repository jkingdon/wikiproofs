== Welcome ==

Hi Kingdon, welcome to Wikiproofs! Feel free to mess around a little with JHilbert. You can also download the program for local use from http://www.mathi.uni-heidelberg.de/~alex/jhilbert/. There, you can find some preliminary documentation. There is also some very preliminary concept documentation in [[:Category:JHilbert]]. Unfortunately, I've been very busy in RL, so nothing much has happened on this site the last few months. But I'm still checking for activity every few days.--[[User:GrafZahl|GrafZahl]]&nbsp;([[User talk:GrafZahl|talk]]) 08:06, 6 January 2010 (UTC)

== Proof and interface modules in user space ==

Hi Kingdon, just so you know: the JHilbert parser is also enabled in the <code>User module</code> and <code>User interface</code> namespaces where you can write your private/testing stuff with more flexibility than in the sandboxes.--[[User:GrafZahl|GrafZahl]]&nbsp;([[User talk:GrafZahl|talk]]) 10:25, 8 January 2010 (UTC)

:Thanks. I just tried it out and it seems to work nicely. [[User:Kingdon|Kingdon]] 19:41, 8 January 2010 (UTC)

== Manual ==

Thank you for starting a JHilbert manual!--[[User:GrafZahl|GrafZahl]]&nbsp;([[User talk:GrafZahl|talk]]) 20:27, 10 January 2010 (UTC)

== Definitions ==

Wow, you're really making great progress with [[Principia Mathematica propositional logic]]!

I wanted to direct your attention to [[User:GrafZahl/Definitions in JHilbert]]. This little essay contains a suggestion of mine to weaken the JHilbert definition mechanism for the sake of simplicity. As you might or might not know, the current definition mechanism is in a bit of a sorry state, with unsoundness lurking everywhere. Maybe you have some input you'd want to share.

Oh, and don't worry about your current work on propositional logic. It is neither affected by any unsoundness in the current definition mechanism, nor would the particular definitions in that proof module cease to work due to my suggested weakening.

:Yes, most of [[Principia Mathematica propositional logic]] is on my laptop and needs to be uploaded (and debugged, which I have been doing as I upload each theorem).  I've been travelling and off the internet which is why I haven't been doing the edits in the usual way.  I also am working on (1) a set of suggestions for improvements to [[Interface:Classical propositional calculus]] and am toying with moving on to one or more of the following projects: (2) Prove that Principia axioms imply Nicod's (probably not too hard, going via Classical propositional logic), (3) Add the Lukasiewicz (Margaris/metamath/Hamilton) propositional logic axioms and prove they are equivalent to the Principia ones, (4) move on to first order logic, since it would be nice to be able to do some real math like number theory or graph theory, and first order logic seems like the next stop towards either Peano or any of the various set theories. 

:As for the definitions, thanks for the notice; I had just run into dummy variables when my naive attempt to prove Tautology blew up. I think I know how to solve that (I'll know after another hour or so of work). Whatever you decide probably does have implications for ⊤ and ⊥, at least the way they are currently implemented, but the vast majority of the propositional logic module would be untouched. [[User:Kingdon|Kingdon]] 23:51, 11 February 2010 (UTC)

::Well, you seem to have a lot of great plans. And congratulations for making classical propositional logic exportable with Principia Mathematica! As for improvements to [[Interface:Classical propositional calculus]], I'll be glad for any suggestions. This will be crucial interface for a large part of mathematics, so it's important it's well thought through by more than just one person. Just be bold. BTW, what do you think about featuring your fine work on [[Principia Mathematica propositional logic]] on the main page, maybe after your improvements have been implemented?--[[User:GrafZahl|GrafZahl]]&nbsp;([[User talk:GrafZahl|talk]]) 14:37, 13 February 2010 (UTC)

:::Featuring our work sounds great (I won't take full credit given how much of it was already there when I started). I've done a cleanup pass. I see that you did at least one copy-edit pass; thanks. If you want to wait on the featuring until after the [[Interface:Classical propositional calculus]] ideas, that's fine, as some of them will get used a lot in [[Principia Mathematica propositional logic]] if we decide we like them.

:::My suggestions are at [[Interface talk:Classical propositional calculus]]; I'd rather be slightly less bold on these ones, partly because every substantive edit requires editing two pages. [[User:Kingdon|Kingdon]] 05:18, 14 February 2010 (UTC)

== Dummies, definitions and all that ==

Thanks for your dummies example (normal dummies in this case) and your continued work in general. You've probably realised that there are efforts under way to change the dummy/definition mechanism of JHilbert/Ghilbert in fundamental ways, and your work is slowly approaching realms where this stuff starts to really matter. Now, until the changes are actually implemented, I expect one or two months to pass ''at the very least''. That's probably an insanely optimistic estimate. The thing is that once the new version goes online, some modules might require non-trivial changes (added proof steps) in order to still verify. That's very unfortunate, but obviously you don't want functionality which leads to unsoundness in your proof verifier, and right now I don't see a way to salvage the current very convenient definition mechanism.--[[User:GrafZahl|GrafZahl]]&nbsp;([[User talk:GrafZahl|talk]]) 18:22, 25 February 2010 (UTC)

:This example won't change with any of the new proposals, I don't think.  In fact the error message is more confusing if you have been following the discussions than if you haven't, which was the main reason for adding it to the manual.  Every time I get confused by an error message, even momentarily, I try to use that as my cue to add it to the manual.  As for needing to update the proofs, part of why I want to push forward on some of these pages is so that you have real-life examples which can help inform your decisions, and I'm not too scared about fixing them when JHilbert changes.  I have no strong opinion about automatic definitions; at times they make a proof really hard to follow but on the flip side making a proof shorter is usually a good thing.

== New featured page ==

Hi, I've started the blurb for the next featured page at [[Template:Featured/Draft]]. Maybe you can edit it a little&hellip; Feel free to choose a better image if you find one. Be careful with EU copyright restrictions, however (70 years pma vs. the US "pre-1923" rule). In particular, photographs of Whitehead or Russell are probably still copyrighted.--[[User:GrafZahl|GrafZahl]]&nbsp;([[User talk:GrafZahl|talk]]) 18:54, 25 February 2010 (UTC)

:Well, I made a stab at a blurb, although feel free to revise if you can think of anything more interesting or otherwise better to say. [[User:Kingdon|Kingdon]] 01:58, 26 February 2010 (UTC)
