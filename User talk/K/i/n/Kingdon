== Welcome ==

Hi Kingdon, welcome to Wikiproofs! Feel free to mess around a little with JHilbert. You can also download the program for local use from http://www.mathi.uni-heidelberg.de/~alex/jhilbert/. There, you can find some preliminary documentation. There is also some very preliminary concept documentation in [[:Category:JHilbert]]. Unfortunately, I've been very busy in RL, so nothing much has happened on this site the last few months. But I'm still checking for activity every few days.--[[User:GrafZahl|GrafZahl]]&nbsp;([[User talk:GrafZahl|talk]]) 08:06, 6 January 2010 (UTC)

== Proof and interface modules in user space ==

Hi Kingdon, just so you know: the JHilbert parser is also enabled in the <code>User module</code> and <code>User interface</code> namespaces where you can write your private/testing stuff with more flexibility than in the sandboxes.--[[User:GrafZahl|GrafZahl]]&nbsp;([[User talk:GrafZahl|talk]]) 10:25, 8 January 2010 (UTC)

:Thanks. I just tried it out and it seems to work nicely. [[User:Kingdon|Kingdon]] 19:41, 8 January 2010 (UTC)

== Manual ==

Thank you for starting a JHilbert manual!--[[User:GrafZahl|GrafZahl]]&nbsp;([[User talk:GrafZahl|talk]]) 20:27, 10 January 2010 (UTC)

== Definitions ==

Wow, you're really making great progress with [[Principia Mathematica propositional logic]]!

I wanted to direct your attention to [[User:GrafZahl/Definitions in JHilbert]]. This little essay contains a suggestion of mine to weaken the JHilbert definition mechanism for the sake of simplicity. As you might or might not know, the current definition mechanism is in a bit of a sorry state, with unsoundness lurking everywhere. Maybe you have some input you'd want to share.

Oh, and don't worry about your current work on propositional logic. It is neither affected by any unsoundness in the current definition mechanism, nor would the particular definitions in that proof module cease to work due to my suggested weakening.

--[[User:GrafZahl|GrafZahl]]&nbsp;([[User talk:GrafZahl|talk]]) 23:05, 11 February 2010 (UTC)

:Yes, most of [[Principia Mathematica propositional logic]] is on my laptop and needs to be uploaded (and debugged, which I have been doing as I upload each theorem).  I've been travelling and off the internet which is why I haven't been doing the edits in the usual way.  I also am working on (1) a set of suggestions for improvements to [[Interface:Classical propositional calculus]] and am toying with moving on to one or more of the following projects: (2) Prove that Principia axioms imply Nicod's (probably not too hard, going via Classical propositional logic), (3) Add the Lukasiewicz (Margaris/metamath/Hamilton) propositional logic axioms and prove they are equivalent to the Principia ones, (4) move on to first order logic, since it would be nice to be able to do some real math like number theory or graph theory, and first order logic seems like the next stop towards either Peano or any of the various set theories. 

:As for the definitions, thanks for the notice; I had just run into dummy variables when my naive attempt to prove Tautology blew up. I think I know how to solve that (I'll know after another hour or so of work). Whatever you decide probably does have implications for ⊤ and ⊥, at least the way they are currently implemented, but the vast majority of the propositional logic module would be untouched. [[User:Kingdon|Kingdon]] 23:51, 11 February 2010 (UTC)

::Well, you seem to have a lot of great plans. And congratulations for making classical propositional logic exportable with Principia Mathematica! As for improvements to [[Interface:Classical propositional calculus]], I'll be glad for any suggestions. This will be crucial interface for a large part of mathematics, so it's important it's well thought through by more than just one person. Just be bold. BTW, what do you think about featuring your fine work on [[Principia Mathematica propositional logic]] on the main page, maybe after your improvements have been implemented?--[[User:GrafZahl|GrafZahl]]&nbsp;([[User talk:GrafZahl|talk]]) 14:37, 13 February 2010 (UTC)

:::Featuring our work sounds great (I won't take full credit given how much of it was already there when I started). I've done a cleanup pass. I see that you did at least one copy-edit pass; thanks. If you want to wait on the featuring until after the [[Interface:Classical propositional calculus]] ideas, that's fine, as some of them will get used a lot in [[Principia Mathematica propositional logic]] if we decide we like them.

:::My suggestions are at [[Interface talk:Classical propositional calculus]]; I'd rather be slightly less bold on these ones, partly because every substantive edit requires editing two pages. [[User:Kingdon|Kingdon]] 05:18, 14 February 2010 (UTC)

== Dummies, definitions and all that ==

Thanks for your dummies example (normal dummies in this case) and your continued work in general. You've probably realised that there are efforts under way to change the dummy/definition mechanism of JHilbert/Ghilbert in fundamental ways, and your work is slowly approaching realms where this stuff starts to really matter. Now, until the changes are actually implemented, I expect one or two months to pass ''at the very least''. That's probably an insanely optimistic estimate. The thing is that once the new version goes online, some modules might require non-trivial changes (added proof steps) in order to still verify. That's very unfortunate, but obviously you don't want functionality which leads to unsoundness in your proof verifier, and right now I don't see a way to salvage the current very convenient definition mechanism.--[[User:GrafZahl|GrafZahl]]&nbsp;([[User talk:GrafZahl|talk]]) 18:22, 25 February 2010 (UTC)

:This example won't change with any of the new proposals, I don't think.  In fact the error message is more confusing if you have been following the discussions than if you haven't, which was the main reason for adding it to the manual.  Every time I get confused by an error message, even momentarily, I try to use that as my cue to add it to the manual.  As for needing to update the proofs, part of why I want to push forward on some of these pages is so that you have real-life examples which can help inform your decisions, and I'm not too scared about fixing them when JHilbert changes.  I have no strong opinion about automatic definitions; at times they make a proof really hard to follow but on the flip side making a proof shorter is usually a good thing. [[User:Kingdon|Kingdon]] 23:20, 25 February 2010 (UTC)

== New featured page ==

Hi, I've started the blurb for the next featured page at [[Template:Featured/Draft]]. Maybe you can edit it a little&hellip; Feel free to choose a better image if you find one. Be careful with EU copyright restrictions, however (70 years pma vs. the US "pre-1923" rule). In particular, photographs of Whitehead or Russell are probably still copyrighted.--[[User:GrafZahl|GrafZahl]]&nbsp;([[User talk:GrafZahl|talk]]) 18:54, 25 February 2010 (UTC)

:Well, I made a stab at a blurb, although feel free to revise if you can think of anything more interesting or otherwise better to say. [[User:Kingdon|Kingdon]] 01:58, 26 February 2010 (UTC)

::I've made some additions. I think it's OK to bring it out now, unless you want to add more stuff.--[[User:GrafZahl|GrafZahl]]&nbsp;([[User talk:GrafZahl|talk]]) 16:58, 5 March 2010 (UTC)

:::Looks ready to me. [[User:Kingdon|Kingdon]] 17:03, 5 March 2010 (UTC)

::::'Tis done.--[[User:GrafZahl|GrafZahl]]&nbsp;([[User talk:GrafZahl|talk]]) 17:17, 5 March 2010 (UTC)

== Peano arithmetic theorems ==

(moved from [[User:Kingdon]], next to the list of theorems to prove in Peano arithmetic).

:Many (but not all) of these are proved in (new) Ghilbert. See [http://levien.com/garden/ghnew/peano/] for the source, but keep in mind I haven't yet pushed the batch or interactive verifier that will accept these. Right now, params to interfaces don't work, so I've had to hand-hack the interface files.

:So, my questions are: Is there some way to gateway these Ghilbert proofs so that they can be imported here? (Or vice versa, for that matter). Is there some place I can jump in and contribute a theorem or two to get started (maybe first-order predicate logic)? [[User:Raph|Raph]] 02:56, 26 February 2010 (UTC)

::Definitely would love to have you jump in and give it a whirl.  First-order logic is what I've been working on lately, and you can see what we have so far in [[:Category:Classical_first-order_logic]].  Feel free to [[w:WP:BOLD|be bold]]; my own personal list of what seems most important is at [[User:Kingdon]] but your ideas of what might be useful are probably as good as mine. My current focus is: (1) getting a few more subst theorems (my experiments, for example [[User interface:Kingdon/Sandbox]] and [[User module:Kingdon/Sandbox]] have led me to think that subst-style induction might work out nicer than finds-style, although I'm not completely convinced on the point), and probably (2) start proving some of the Peano theorems (for one thing this is a way of finding out what is missing in the first-order logic). [[User:Kingdon|Kingdon]] 03:44, 26 February 2010 (UTC)

== Administrator ==

I'd like to ask you if you'd be interested in administrator access to this wiki. Your prolific work occasionally requires changes to protected pages (most notably [[Mediawiki:Edittools]]) and you obviously have enough experience with the MediaWiki software for reasonable use of the admin tools. On the other hand, if you feel uncomfortable being an admin, I see no problem in continuing our current practise of change on request.--[[User:GrafZahl|GrafZahl]]&nbsp;([[User talk:GrafZahl|talk]]) 16:34, 5 March 2010 (UTC)

:Fine with me.  At our current size, or likely size any time soon, I don't think it will be too much of a burden/distraction. [[User:Kingdon|Kingdon]] 16:38, 5 March 2010 (UTC)

::OK, you are now an admin.--[[User:GrafZahl|GrafZahl]]&nbsp;([[User talk:GrafZahl|talk]]) 17:01, 5 March 2010 (UTC)

== Thank you ==

Hi Kingdon. Thank you so much for all your content contributions, your talk page posts and the occasional vandal block. Right now I'm pretty much occupied elsewhere (my Ph.D. thesis is finally reaching critical mass), so I don't have any significant time to spare for Wikiproofs, JHilbert and all that. I hope I'll come back in the not too distant future.--[[User:GrafZahl|GrafZahl]]&nbsp;([[User talk:GrafZahl|talk]]) 09:31, 27 July 2010 (UTC)

:Thanks for letting me know (I had guessed as much, but it is nice to hear an update from time to time). I do appreciate whatever small amount of time you may have, and hope that your PhD goes well. I too am certainly hoping that you'll find some time at some point, as a lot of the stuff you have been interested in would benefit my efforts too. [[User:Kingdon|Kingdon]] 23:08, 27 July 2010 (UTC)

== Server crash ==

Hi Kingdon, in case you were wondering, the server crashed at about 1:32 UTC this night with what I believe was an out of memory problem. I rebooted and it seems to work fine again. Hopefully, it won't happen again too soon.--[[User:GrafZahl|GrafZahl]]&nbsp;([[User talk:GrafZahl|talk]]) 08:27, 26 August 2010 (UTC)

:Thanks for keeping me informed. Doesn't sound like there is anything worth doing about it unless perhaps if it starts happening often. [[Special:Contributions/97.73.64.163|97.73.64.163]] 21:52, 28 August 2010 (UTC)

::Hi Kingdon, once again the server crashed this night at about 5:30 UTC, again due to lack of memory. It seems to be in working order again.--[[User:GrafZahl|GrafZahl]]&nbsp;([[User talk:GrafZahl|talk]]) 09:34, 12 November 2010 (UTC)

== wikiproofs.org ==

Hi, today I registered the domain [http://www.wikiproofs.org wikiproofs.org] in addition to wikiproofs.de. The .org domain seems more appropriate for an international non-profit project. My provider tells me that it may take up to 48 hours until the new domain correctly resolves to the Wikiproofs host everywhere in the world. I'd have registered the .org domain earlier but there used to be another site sitting on it (possibly intended as a non-formal proof wiki, but it always looked kinda defunct to me). I'll try to switch MediaWiki and the web server over to use .org by default when the 48 hours have passed.--[[User:GrafZahl|GrafZahl]]&nbsp;([[User talk:GrafZahl|talk]]) 16:35, 1 September 2010 (UTC)

:Hmm. The .org is probably a bit easier to confuse with [http://www.proofwiki.org/wiki/Main_Page proofwiki.org] which as far as I can tell is non-defunct. But use your best judgement. [[User:Kingdon|Kingdon]] 17:52, 1 September 2010 (UTC)
