== Welcome ==

Hi Kingdon, welcome to Wikiproofs! Feel free to mess around a little with JHilbert. You can also download the program for local use from http://www.mathi.uni-heidelberg.de/~alex/jhilbert/. There, you can find some preliminary documentation. There is also some very preliminary concept documentation in [[:Category:JHilbert]]. Unfortunately, I've been very busy in RL, so nothing much has happened on this site the last few months. But I'm still checking for activity every few days.--[[User:GrafZahl|GrafZahl]]&nbsp;([[User talk:GrafZahl|talk]]) 08:06, 6 January 2010 (UTC)

== Proof and interface modules in user space ==

Hi Kingdon, just so you know: the JHilbert parser is also enabled in the <code>User module</code> and <code>User interface</code> namespaces where you can write your private/testing stuff with more flexibility than in the sandboxes.--[[User:GrafZahl|GrafZahl]]&nbsp;([[User talk:GrafZahl|talk]]) 10:25, 8 January 2010 (UTC)

:Thanks. I just tried it out and it seems to work nicely. [[User:Kingdon|Kingdon]] 19:41, 8 January 2010 (UTC)

== Manual ==

Thank you for starting a JHilbert manual!--[[User:GrafZahl|GrafZahl]]&nbsp;([[User talk:GrafZahl|talk]]) 20:27, 10 January 2010 (UTC)

== Definitions ==

Wow, you're really making great progress with [[Principia Mathematica propositional logic]]!

I wanted to direct your attention to [[User:GrafZahl/Definitions in JHilbert]]. This little essay contains a suggestion of mine to weaken the JHilbert definition mechanism for the sake of simplicity. As you might or might not know, the current definition mechanism is in a bit of a sorry state, with unsoundness lurking everywhere. Maybe you have some input you'd want to share.

Oh, and don't worry about your current work on propositional logic. It is neither affected by any unsoundness in the current definition mechanism, nor would the particular definitions in that proof module cease to work due to my suggested weakening.
