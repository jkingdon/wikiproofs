== Blanking ==

Thanks for blanking the spammy page which was at [[XERXESYALITZA75]]. I have deleted it. If you have any questions about wikiproofs, please ask. [[User:Kingdon|Kingdon]] ([[User talk:Kingdon|talk]]) 05:14, 16 May 2012 (UTC)

== Wikiproofs ==

I took a stab at answering your question at [[User talk:Kingdon#Wikiproofs]]. I focussed on the modules, as that might be the #1 win over metamath, but the syntax makes it less easy to shoot oneself in the foot and there might be other things I'm not thinking of right now. We don't really have a detailed comparison with metamath (either in terms of the proof verifier itself, or the existing proof libraries), but I suppose perhaps I could try to write something like that and I'm certainly willing to answer questions. We're also quite open to contributions if you know some Java and want to work on the verifier itself (as described at [[Wikiproofs:JHilbert development]]). Does that help explain what advantages JHilbert has over metamath? [[User:Kingdon|Kingdon]] ([[User talk:Kingdon|talk]]) 00:24, 20 May 2012 (UTC)

== Example of exporting some axioms and then importing theorems proved from them ==

I've been thinking about my claim that one could prove, for example, field or ring axioms and then import theorems which derive from them. It seemed like a good idea to have an example of actually doing this. Take a look at  [[Basic arithmetic#Consequences of total order properties]] and the various interfaces and proof modules which it refers to when it exports total order axioms and then imports total order theorems. Would love to hear your reactions (for one thing, whether the process is well-explained there). [[User:Kingdon|Kingdon]] ([[User talk:Kingdon|talk]]) 03:51, 13 June 2012 (UTC)
