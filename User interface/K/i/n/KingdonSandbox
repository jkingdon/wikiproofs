== Principia logical axioms without the "twist" in Assoc ==

In introducing their form of the associative law for disjunction, Whitehead and Russell provide a form which includes a commutation in place of the more natural one which does not. This page is a version of those axioms with form which Whitehead and Russell term more natural in place of the one which they actually adopt.

First the axioms of [[Interface:Principia Mathematica propositional logic]] other than the one in question:
<jh>
kind (wff)
var (wff p q r)
term (wff (¬ wff)) # Negation
term (wff (∨ wff wff)) # Disjunction
def ((→ p q) ((¬ p) ∨ q)) # Implication, *1.01
def ((∧ p q) (¬ ((¬ p) ∨ (¬ q)))) # Conjunction, *3.01
def ((↔ p q) ((p → q) ∧ (q → p))) # Biconditional, *4.01
stmt (applyModusPonens () (p (p → q)) q) # *1.1
stmt (Taut () () ((p ∨ p) → p)) # *1.2
stmt (Add () () (q → (p ∨ q))) # *1.3
stmt (Perm () () ((p ∨ q) → (q ∨ p))) # *1.4
stmt (Sum () () ((q → r) → ((p ∨ q) → (p ∨ r)))) # *1.6
</jh>

Here is the form of the associative law which Russell and Whitehead, in the discussion of their *1.5, term the "more natural" form:<ref>{{sc|A. Whitehead, B. Russell}}, Principia Mathematica, ''Cambridge University Press'', 1910, page 101.</ref>
<jh>
stmt (NaturalAssoc () () ((p ∨ (q ∨ r)) → ((p ∨ q) ∨ r)))
</jh>
