 | notes    = This interface collects important theorems from first-order logic, which builds on [[Interface:Classical propositional calculus|propositional logic]] by adding quantifiers ("for all" and "there exists") and equality. It is meant as a user-friendly reservoir for those interfaces and proof modules which merely use first-order logic, without proving anything new within it.

Statements can be added if necessary, but then the exporting modules have to be updated accordingly.

== Formulas, objects, and quantification ==
We build on [[Interface:Classical propositional calculus]]:
<jh>
param (CLASSICAL Interface:Classical_propositional_calculus () ())
</jh>

By convention we use φ, ψ, χ, and θ to represent formulas (also known as ''well-formed formulas'' or wff's).
<jh>
var (wff φ ψ χ θ)
</jh>

We use the term ''object'' to refer to something which is subject to quantification or equality. From an axiomatic point of view, what is a valid object is defined implicitly, by axioms such as those of [[w:Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory|ZFC set theory]] or [[w:Peano axioms|Peano arithmetic]].

<jh>
kind (object)
var (object x y z)
</jh>

We extend the available formulas with [[w:Universal quantification|universal quantification]] and [[w:Existential quantification|existential quantification]]:
<jh>
term (wff (∀ object wff))
term (wff (∃ object wff))
</jh>

== Equality ==
Equality is reflexive, symmetry, and transitive.
<jh>
term (wff (= object object))
stmt (EqualityReflexivity () () (x = x))
</jh>
