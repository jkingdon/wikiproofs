Part of the experiment into rejigging quantifiers (from a universe of sets to a more restricted universe).

To think about: Is there a need to justify/prove these statements now that they are fairly simple?

To think about: the result should satisfy all the axioms of [[Interface:Axioms of first-order logic]]. Seems like this could probably be proved, but maybe believing it to be possible would suffice for now. I don't think we need that to just get something past JHilbert, though (since statements are not read from params). Also on the subject of axioms versus the full [[Interface:First-order logic with quantifiability]] is whether we need to mention <code>∃</code> and <code>subst</code>.
