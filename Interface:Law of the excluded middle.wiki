To state the axiom, we need formulas including disjunction and negation. We could provide this via a parameter, but here we merely define the few things required for our axiom.
<jh>
kind (formula)
var (formula p)
term (formula (∨ formula formula))
term (formula (¬ formula))
</jh>

Here is the axiom:
<jh>
stmt (TertiumNonDatur () () (p ∨ (¬ p)))
</jh>

== Equivalent axioms ==
Assuming [[Interface:Intuitionistic propositional logic]], a variety of axioms all have the effect of producing classical propositional logic.  The law of the excluded middle is one of them.  A few others are:
<dl>
<dt>double negation elimination</dt>
<dd>¬ ¬ p → p</dd>
<dt>transposition elimination</dt>
<dd>(¬ q → ¬ p) → (p → q)</dd>
<dt>case elimination</dt>
<dd>(p → q) ∧ (¬ p → q) → q</dd>
<dt>Peirce's law</dt>
<dd>((p → q) → p) → p</dd>
</dl>
