 | notes    = Since [[w:Euclid|Euclid]], compass-and-straightedge geometry has been presented as following from postulates. However, it was not until the 20th century that a complete set of postulates were put forward. This page is for one such set, the [[w:Tarski's axioms|first-order axiomization by Tarski]].  It makes reference to points (not directly to lines, angles, or circles), and has two relationships between points: betweenness and congruence.

First, we adopt the axioms of [[Interface:Classical propositional calculus|propositional logic]] and [[Interface:First-order logic with quantifiability|first-order logic]] (including equality):

<jh>
param (CLASSICAL Interface:Classical_propositional_calculus () ())
param (FIRSTORDER Interface:First-order_logic_with_quantifiability (CLASSICAL) ())
</jh>

The kind <code>object</code>, defined in first-order logic, represents a point:
<jh>
kindbind (object point)
var (point x y z w u v)

var (variable a b c)
</jh>

== Congruence ==
We introduce congruence; <code>(x y ≡ w z)</code> means that the line segment xy is the same length as the line segment wz.
<jh>
term (formula (≡ point point point point))
</jh>

The distance from x to y is the same as the distance from y to x.  This property is called reflexivity.
<jh>
stmt (CongruenceReflexivity () () (x y ≡ y x))
</jh>

A segment which has zero length starts and ends at the same point (although saying "zero length" is a bit of a shortcut, as the axioms are not based on real numbers or any other numbers).
<jh>
stmt (CongruenceIdentity () () ((x y ≡ z z) → (x = y)))
</jh>

Two segments which are congruent to a common segment are congruent to each other.
<jh>
stmt (CongruenceTransitivity () () (((x y ≡ z u) ∧ (x y ≡ v w)) → (z u ≡ v w)))
</jh>

== Betweenness ==
The other fundamental formula is betweenness; <code>(between x y z)</code> signifies "y is between x and z".

<jh>
term (formula (between point point point))
</jh>

There are no other points between x and x.
<jh>
stmt (Indivisibility () () ((between x y x) → (x = y)))
</jh>

=== Pasch's axiom ===
[[File:Tarski's formulation of Pasch's axiom.svg|left|thumb]]
Tarski's version of the [[w:Axiom of Pasch]].
{{clear}}
<jh>
stmt (Pasch () () (((between x u z) ∧ (between y v z)) → (∃ a ((between u (value a) y) ∧ (between v (value a) x)))))
</jh>

=== Continuity ===
<jh>
var (formula φx ψy)
#stmt (Continuity ((φx y) (φx a) (φx b) (ψy x) (ψy a) (ψy b)) () ())
</jh>
