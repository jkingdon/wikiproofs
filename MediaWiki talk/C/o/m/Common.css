== color of .jhilbert .kind ==

I've taken the liberty of changing the color of .jhilbert .kind.  It had been a very bright green (#00ff00) which at least to my eyes had insufficient contrast with the background (#eeeeee) and looked much worse than the other colors we have.  I'm giving #33cc33 a try (lowers the saturation from 100 to 75 and the value from 100 to 80, while keeping the same hue), but if anyone else wants to weigh in, speak up.
